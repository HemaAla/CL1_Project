[ u'In the previous lectures we have looked at 
materials with different interesting electrical 
properties 
And we covered on giant magneto resistance 
we covered some issues on colossal 
magneto resistance which is typical of a perovskite 
based compound And we have 
looked at the possibility of tunnelling magneto 
resistance in multilayer\u2019s and one of the 
other lectures we also looked at the possibility 
of inducing magnetism and therefore 
making a semiconductor a magnetic material 
In today\u2019s lecture I am going to cover little 
bit from the materials chemistry point of 
view on one of the other exciting field which 
has brought more focus into fundamental 
issues on mixed metal oxides that is the 
issue of super conductivity in oxides otherwise 
not known until So this is a discovery 
which has almost brought a fresh look at all 
the research that is going around metal oxide 
chemistry and the cartoon that you are 
seeing in the front screen here is a unmanned 
maglev train which is running at the speed 
of kilometres which is actually operated 
using a superconducting coil 
So the fascination of superconductivity can 
go to any extent right from basic research 
to 
the other issues of materials world where 
we can really feel it and experience it So 
in 
this lecture I am going to tell you more about 
the chemistry point of view of 
superconductivity and what are all the fascinations 
that we can look in one single 
crystal lattice 
Before I start with issues pertaining to superconductors 
just to familiarize our self of the 
range of materials that we have starting 
from simple conductors to insulators to 
semiconductors And then we have a special 
place for superconductors which usually 
normally behave as a metal at a particular 
point this metal transforms into a 
superconductor 
If you look at the history of superconductors 
it is almost years since the discovery 
of 
super conductor has been made it was exactly 
years back in Kammerlingh 
onnes developed the process of liquefying 
helium And when we liquefied helium he 
found that mercury was going to a resistivity 
in other words it shows resistance at 
K that is the boiling point of liquid 
helium Since then this area has picked up 
and in 
onnes was awarded the noble prize for 
superconductivity 
And this is one of the first results from 
Kammerlingh onnes where you can see there 
is a 
metallic state as you cool the mercury and 
at K there is a sharp drop in the 
resistance And the resistance is of the order 
of power minus ohms resistance 
state it achieves as a result mercury behaves 
like a superconductor and as you know 
mercury is one of the metal which is existing 
in liquid state So there have been lot of 
studies on other metals 
So the search for superconductors at higher 
temperature has been the focus since this 
discovery and other metals found to be superconductors 
are lead at K niobium at 
K And then came this a type metals 
or alloys this is niobium stannide alloy 
and 
then you have niobium germanium all this 
shows around Kelvin and maximum 
superconducting temperature that has been 
achieved up to Since the discovery 
has 
been only K 
And nevertheless with this finding several 
useful applications have happened over the 
years and these metals are malleable therefore 
you can make it into any shape 
Therefore these alloys have been made into 
some device purposes and specially in 
superconducting coils these alloys have been 
used and they are applied in even NMR 
instruments But this excitement lasted only 
until when there was a paradigm shift 
in this work or in this field 
Mainly because of that discovery that struck 
in before we look at the major 
discoveries in this field I just want to 
show you that most of the elements in the 
periodic 
table do show superconductivity at some temperature 
And all the ones which are marked 
blue here those are superconducting at ambient 
temperatures but if you actually go for 
non metallic regions specially a a and 
a elements they do show superconductivity 
at high pressure So quite a good number 
of elements do show this strange property 
But what really was the break through is 
the high temperature superconductors in 
George Bednorz and Karl Muller they are from 
IBM facility at Zurich They observed 
superconductivity in a compound which is 
called lanthanum barium cuprate it is a K 

N a F type of a compound the crystal structure 
resembles that of a K N a type And 
this ceramic compound is actually considered 
to be a anti ferromagnetic insulator 
Because if you look at the crystal structure 
the copper oxygen planes which are inter 
stacked in this unit cell they are actually 
anti ferromagnetic ally aligned and the 
electrical conductivity actually shows it 
is a antiferromagnetic insulator So you 
can not 
get anything out of this compound all you 
can try to do is you can try to increase the 
whole mobility by substituting with some divalent 
metal in the lanthanum site And as a 
result you can improve little bit of the conductivity 
where you can take it from a 
insulating state to a semiconducting state 
this was all known 
So the breakthrough was when you try to cool 
the sample at low temperatures then you 
see from the metallic state it goes to a superconducting 
state and in because of this 
path breaking discovery Bednorz and Muller 
won the noble prize in the field of 
superconductivity The reason why it was path 
breaking is ceramics are not supposed to 
be showing any metallic property and it is 
not just showing metallic nature but it is 
also 
superconducting in nature 
Therefore a ceramic which is considered to 
be a rather insulator turning to a 
superconductor has been the path breaking 
discovery there Nevertheless the excitement 
that generated lead Paul Chu and his coworkers 
at the university of Houston to replace 
some of the lanthanum with yttrium and then 
they produced another ceramic that super 
conducts at Kelvin instead of the one which 
shows at Kelvin So it this was a 
quantum jump when this discovery was made 
If we now relate to yttrium barium copper 
oxide you would see most of the applications 
are now based mostly on this compound which 
is named as YBCO or YBCO which 
stands for yttrium barium copper oxide or 
some people also nickname this as 
compound Because the stoichiometry of yttrium 
to barium to copper is is to is to 
therefore this is popularly referred to as 
compound or YBCO compound And 
many of the practical applications today in 
this field is based on yttrium barium copper 
oxide 
Now if you look at this short history of 
superconducting materials you would see from 
finding the superconductivity in mercury way 
back in as you scan through there is 
a shift in focus after Since then it 
has always been mostly on the oxide chemistry 
whereas in the previous years decades you 
see it is mostly on several phases or inter 
metallic compounds So there is a paradigm 
shift after where you start looking at 
the oxide chemistry in greater detail 
And as you would see here in most of the 
compounds that are listed we have 
transcended from Kelvin all the way up 
to Kelvin So the quest is to go as close 
to the room temperature so that the implications 
of superconductivity can be realized in 
energy sector and in many other electronic 
environments If you look at the type of 
oxides that you we have listed here what 
you would clearly see is that these are all 
mainly based on copper 
So these are popularly known as cuprates 
because the basic structure revolves around 
the copper oxygen planes or sheets So mainly 
this is copper chemistry where this 
bivalent and trivalent a side cations are 
providing the required chemistry of the lattice 
structure for this strange phenomena to occur 
So by and large if you look at the oxide 
chemistry it is only cuprates and there has 
been no other report on a non oxide non 
copper oxide lattice or compound which is 
showing high T c 
And lastly in the part decade we had 
another strange discovery of magnesium 
bromide which shows superconductivity at 
Kelvin that again is a serendipity we will 
come to this issue later 
If you try to mark from the previous table 
a plot of years versus T c in Kelvin you 
would 
see 
that there are two plateaus one with all 
the metals a marginal increase has been 
aimed at And then from onwards you see 
a phenomenal jump in the T c so there are 
two plateaus for this range of a compounds 
one is to do with the metallic\u2019s and then 
you 
see a skyrocketing influence of this cuprates 
in increasing the high T c 
So the first cuprate superconductor L a 
minus x B a x C u O was discovered by 
Bednorz and Muller in and if you view 
the crystal lattice in different perception 
this is what you would see And as you see 
here this is a nothing but a perovskite two 
perovskite layers are sandwiching a L a O 
layer So you have a two perovskite layers 
and in between these two perovskite unit cells 
you have a lanthanum oxide sheet which 
is separating and that\u2019s what\u2019s you would 
see here Roughly this is one perovskite and 
this is one perovskite and the intermediate 
layer is here lanthanum oxide 
So that\u2019s exactly what would bring in the 
layered nature so A B O is nothing but 
A 
B O repeat with a interlayer A O So this 
forms you k A O N A structure and as 
you would see here this is one unit cell 
and in this unit cell you have copper in the 
a b 
basal plane and its not along the c axis 
and this is the a b plane interaction which 
makes 
this a superconducting compound 
Similarly yttrium barium copper oxide which 
actually shows the superconductivity at 
Kelvin this also has a very unique perovskite 
lattice and in this lattice you can see 
yttrium barium copper in is to is to 
is to proportion So it is that\u2019s why 
it is called 
compound you can see here these two 
are the barium and in between you have 
the yttrium and copper oxygen planes are 
in the terminal edges 
So basically this unit is actually based 
on C u O or C u O planes or C u O pyramidal 
units this C u O units is what brings about 
this sort of a crystal structure with inter 
planes coming from yttrium oxide and barium 
oxide So this is another projection of the 
yttrium barium copper we will look into the 
chemistry because what is fascinating from 
the materials chemistry point of view is 
the constituents in this lattice And how 
when 
we vary the this crystal structure how the 
property can be adversely affected 
The K super conductor actually 
was found by chu et al if you calculate the 
number of oxygen in this lattice you would 
see that apparently the oxygen vacancies are 
randomly distributed among the oxygen size 
And this unit cell actually has oxygen 
atoms and this oxygen atoms their random 
occupancy and how they can be taken out 
of the lattice put inside the lattice will 
determine whether this particular compound 
will 
be superconducting or not 
In the next few slides I will show you when 
we discuss about the chemistry of it how 
vulnerable this oxygen atoms could be And 
if your not very careful in maintain this 
oxygen\u2019s in the preferred lattice sites 
you will end up with a insulating compound 
which 
is not going to even be metallic So that 
is the chemistry which is rich in this lattice 
cell 
And then we will look at it typically this 
compound shows a very excellent 
transition and the onset is somewhere around 
and it goes to a absolute state as 
close as And if look at the delta T it 
is very very small and this transition shows 
that 
the whole sample is superconducting and it 
is not a biphasic compound it is a 
monophasic compound As a result the delta 
is very very narrow of the order of just 
to 
Kelvin And smaller the delta T then you 
can be sure that your whole compound the 
bulk is actually superconducting you would 
also find out that if there is a biphasic 
compound or some impurities are there delta 
T can be more than K which clearly 
indicates that there is a insulating phase 
that is present in the compound 
So what is the phenomena of high T c ? And 
what do we learn from here ? 
When we think of superconducting properties 
there are three parameters that we need to 
familiarise our self and these three are 
critical to decide whether this can actually 
be 
transformed or used into used in the applications 
And whether they can really contribute 
to making devices so when we think about 
this three parameters all three are critical 
therefore it is called critical temperature 
critical current density and critical magnetic 
field 
Critical temperature T c is this is not curie 
temperature this is critical temperature 
meaning the temperature at which the substance 
goes to resistance So it has to show 
resistance therefore that is what we call 
it as T c and in such a state what is the 
critical 
current density in other words how much of 
the current that this material can hold it 
can 
hold without a loss So that measure that 
can also be measured using physical 
experiments so critical current density is 
one way to map whether your materials can 
be 
used for application or not 
And then critical magnetic field is another 
issue where the material can sustain only 
a 
particular amount of magnetic field beyond 
which the flux density of the applied field 
can go into the compound in other words it 
will remove that diamagnetic state So when 
the compound can ripple that particular amount 
of field that is called as critical magnetic 
field and that is the strength of you superconductor 
the diamagnetic state So all this 
three has to be measured so when we think 
about superconducting oxide we need to 
have this three issues in picture 
Now when I talk about this critical field 
then the first thing that comes to our mind 
is the 
property that governs this superconductor 
one is the most important property is the 

electrical resistance And the next one is 
the anti state anti magnetism is nothing 
but a 
diamagnetic state in other words the material 
may not be diamagnetic at room 
temperature But when you cooling there is 
something happening with the lattice which 
makes this material a diamagnetic material 
as a result it will expel the magnetic field 
And when it is in a diamagnetic situation 
that is below the critical T c point that 
is below 
T c it is in a perfect diamagnetic state 
and in that state one of the manifestation 
is the 
magnetic levitation So as you would see 
here this is a superconductor superconductor 
actually when it kept inside when it kept 
in a field it will ripple So the flux will 
not 
permeate through the sample and this is the 
diamagnetic situation 
But over the critical field then the flux 
can actually go into the superconducting 
material and this is not the high T c phase 
So in at high T c you would see this 
expulsion of the flux density so magnetic 
field completely expels due to super currents 
created on the super conductor and this is 
termed as a antimagnetic state 
So if the sample is in a levitated situation 
or in a diamagnetic situation one of the most 
important manifestation is it can actually 
lift up a magnet So in this cartoon you 
would 
see this and in the next cartoon a animation 
is there where you will understand this So 
if there is a magnetic levitation then it 
is actually due to meissner effect where the 
pairs 
of electrons are in single quantum state with 
resistance As a result since they are 
paired up they attain a diamagnetic situation 
which will actually ripple the magnetic 
field 
So superconducting electron pairs move without 
resistance to counteract the applied 
field from magnet hence we get this perfect 
diamagnetism and as a result it manifest 
with the magnetic levitation In fact this 
magnetic levitation is the true response of 
a 
superconductor of any superconductor therefore 
the magnetic levitation is one of a very 
fundamental application that we can derive 
from a any super conducting material In the 
next cartoons I will show you a demo of how 
this superconductor works and how this 
issue of magnetic levitation can be extended 
to practical application and after than we 
can look at the chemistry of this oxides 
So levitation of a superconductor in a magnetic 
field if you place a superconducting 
compound on a bar magnet you would see nothing 
happens when temperature is above 
T c But when temperature is below T c this 
material is actually lifted up and it can 
float 
and this is called the Meissner Oschenfeld 
effect which is popularly known as magnetic 
levitation 
You would see in this cartoon a demonstration 
of how magnet can float on a 
superconducting object as you see here this 
is this is your magnet and this is the 
superconducting compound which is a black 
block And now in the cartoon you would 
see nitrogen liquid nitrogen will be poured 
into this block so you can see this magnet 
is 
now actually placed on the superconductor 
And nothing happens a magnet a the there is 
no repelling response there 
Now we can pour some liquid nitrogen on this 
block and cool that black block which is 
nothing but your superconductor So now 
the material is going to liquid nitrogen state 
and now if you place that magnet you can see 
the magnet is actually floating and you 
can also see the magnet is rotating So there 
is a field that is expelling the magnet and 
when the material is actually in a superconducting 
state 
Now if we can take the block out then the 
material will again come back towards room 
temperature and in that state you would see 
than the material does not behave like a 
superconductor You can see here the force 
that is applied on the magnet but still magnet 
is being rippled by the superconductor so 
the currents inside the super conductor is 
very 
strong to through away this magnetic force 
Now you can see even you can lift it in such 
a situation and suppose you keep it out say 
the liquid nitrogen you can see this black 
block is now getting back to room temperature 
And as it crosses the critical temperature 
then the magnet comes and falls back This 
is 
the Meissner effect that you can see and 
critical issues there is that the whole phase 
the 
bulk of this material has to be superconducting 
in order to eject or ripple the magnet 
You would see same manifestation in a form 
of a train 
Where you can realize a floating train using 
the same issue of superconductor and here 
you can see a small engine sort of a stuff 
is made and the belt is actually made of 
a 
magnet So you can see that this engine is 
actually now floating on the magnet and now 
we can freeze this superconducting material 
and you can put it on the magnet pathway 
then you can see that it is actually hanging 
on the track So if you place this 
superconductor on the track and if you give 
a small momentum you would see this high 
T c superconductor is actually going around 
the track 
You can see here that this single pellet of 
compound is actually going and the 
moment it loses it is critical temperature 
it falls down on the track 
Now you can do the same thing put the black 
material a engine sort of a module and we 
can see how this can rotate friction less 
and still it is bound by the influence of 
the 
magnetic field And this is the way the magnetic 
levitation works and this is a prototype 
of engine which can be operated and this 
is the module that has been used by this group 
which is meant to accelerate the propulsion 
actually comes from a device which is 
hanging there So when the floatation occurs 
depending on the propulsion it can go 
faster or lower and that is shown here 
Now you can again put some superconducting 
material inside the engine and we can try 
to bring it to critical current and based 
on the propulsion that you use we can now 
maximize the acceleration and it can go in 
any speed And you can try to deaccelerate 
and bring it again to a controlled speed 
so both are possible and this is the phenomena 
of 
levitation that is useful to apply a in many 
of the applications 
Now let us go more into the structural aspects 
and find out what is the essence of the 
superconductivity ? And what is really controlling 
this phenomena in oxide materials As 
you know yttrium barium copper oxide is not 
a simple oxide it is a complex oxide 
therefore making this material itself is 
a herculean task although no any undergraduate 
labs can even perform this experiment 
In the initial days it was very difficult 
to understand the chemistry of this because 
even if 
you miss out little bit on the synthetic part 
you might end up with a nonsuperconducting 
phase which will be a green compound So 
synthesis is important and 
then once you have a feel on synthesis you 
can try to play around with this structure 
and 
also on the stochiometry So I will tell 
you how everything progressed over the years 
This is a cartoon where you can find out 
how critical making this material is and 
as you 
would see here this is a thermo gravimetry 
just gives you an idea how the solid state 
reaction happens You take moles of yttrium 
oxide and moles of barium carbonate 
and moles of copper oxide and this has 
to be ground intimately for many hours And 
then once this is intimately mixed then you 
can heat this material and the material has 
to 
be heated from room temperature up to 
degree C 
And during this time you would see carbon 
dioxide going out of barium carbonate other 
than that all the other mixtures are oxides 
So once the carbon dioxide escapes than you 
would see there is a weight loss of say around 
percent and then the final compound is 
actually formed here The final compound actually 
corresponds to YABCO but problem 
here is if barium oxide is also stable then 
it is easy to take all the component oxides 
into 
picture and make the phase much more easier 
But barium oxide is very reactive therefore 
always it ends up with barium carbonate 
and barium carbonate undergoes decomposition 
only above degree C Therefore the 
reaction between yttrium copper and barium 
has to happen only above and the 
nominal temperature is achieved at degree 
C Problem is when the mixture is being 
heated there are chances that some intermediate 
compounds can form between reactive 
yttria and copper oxide and when that happens 
then the stochiometry suffers 
So this is the problem with such a superconductor 
so many chemical routes wet 
chemical routes have been brought where barium 
carbonate can be avoided and reactive 
barium oxide can be used One of the convenient 
way that this has been achieved is take 
barium peroxide and barium peroxide above 
degree C releases reactive barium 
oxide As a result then above any temperature 
above you will have a very reactive 
mixture of yttrium oxide barium oxide and 
copper oxide Therefore the single phase 
compound can be made with ease So there 
are lot of intricate issues that are involved 
in 
synthesis I will not run through every detail 
but then show you how to make such a 
single phase compound from solid state method 
Once you take yttrium barium copper oxide 
and then you heat it at degrees in air 
for 
say hours the first pattern that you would 
see from the XRD powder XRD pattern is 
a peak resembling something like this This 
is corresponding to and you would 
see 
a small reflection here and then the major 
peak that comes here will be around 
degrees which corresponds to andAs you would see here this major peak actually 
has a splitting and this splitting actually 
corresponds to so if you see a splitting 
the main peak then ; that means a this is 
orthorhombic phase And that orthorhombic 
phase is actually a superconducting phase 
but what you would notice here is that it 
should be O according to this formula 
Because yttrium is plus barium is plus 
and copper is in plus because of cooper 
So plus you as actually get as 
the stochiometry compound but you would see 
the range is anywhere between to and 
that is what makes this particular compound 
very interesting Because you have labile 
oxygen\u2019s which can be incorporated or 
removed which controls the superconducting 
state therefore this becomes a rich 
chemistry to achieve a fully oxygenated compound 
good enough to give a clear T c at 
Kelvin 
One of the other signatures that you should 
follow when we look at orthorhombic phase 
is this splitting and the splitting comes 
somewhere comes somewhere around degree 
which is indexed to both or 
If this peak is a single peak then it 
resembles 
it is a tetragonal phase and in that case 
even this major peak will not have this splitting 
So if there is no splitting then it is a 
tetragonal phase and if there is splitting 
it is a 
orthorhombic phase So you can easily map 
whether you are working at a critical 
oxygen containing compound if it is not the 
orthorhombic compound you can be sure 
that it is not going to be superconducting 
So you can have fine tuning done just by 
looking at the x ray mapping 
As you would see here this minus x or 
minus delta is very critical because as you 
vary from down to according to the stochiometry 
you can also see the T c drops to 
a nonsuperconducting state When it is a 
superconductor you can clearly get a Kelvin 
T c and that is nearly as oxygenated compound 
So where does this oxygen go that we 
can see from the crystal lattice if you take 
a closer look at it 
Now one more thing we need to understand 
if you do a TG and DTG you would find 
out that it loses oxygen when you heat up 
to degree And therefore freshly 
synthesized sample at when it is actually 
cooled down at room temperature it will 
actually be a fully non stochiometric compound 
with oxygen value ranging from to 
So Y B a C u O to is 
very critical for the superconducting phase 
to 
occur 
You would also see if you do the same TG 
at degree per minute and at degree per 
minute there are many useful inflection that 
are coming If you look at the derivative 
TG 
graph at n there is a peak at n there 
is a peak n there is a peak and n so 
there are 
four different temperature zones at which 
oxygen is getting desorbed So we need to 
be 
very cautious about this desorption that is 
occurring we can not control this degree 
C 
because it is at high temperature 
Therefore it is important if we need to achieve 
this we need to be very careful to 
anneal this compound at because that is 
where the oxygen exchange is happening 
So any sample which is prepared before we 
measure the superconductivity you need to 
make sure that there is a post annealing that 
is done at around degree C for a long 
time So that enough oxygen\u2019s are getting 
incorporated into the lattice and that is 
what 
we see if you do it at a faster rate probably 
you do not see the n n but there are 
only 
three zones but nevertheless n is still 
there Therefore this range say from 
to 
degree C the annealing has to be done in oxygen 
annealing in oxygen has to be done 
So that you get a fully oxygenated sample 
to achieve stochiometry 
So the issue of a oxygen content actually 
brings us back into focus what sort of a unit 
cell that we have And if we take a close 
look at it we see that the barium ions are 
placed 
here and the yttrium ions is actually separating 
these two perovskite units cell and then 
you would see copper in this n chain and 
also copper along the c axis So this is 
a 
copper oxygen unit in the a b plane and 
we also have copper oxygen unit in the c axis 
So the coordination of this copper oxygen 
unit actually is different in this case this 
is of 
a square planar nature and this is pyramidal 
because it is actually getting linked with 
the 
apical oxygen So two types of coordination\u2019s 
are there apart from that we would also 
try to take a close look at the oxygen occupancy 
you would see here this is mainly based 
on the copper oxygen sheets that are prevailing 
in the a b plane 
And there are also oxygen\u2019s along the c 
axis and the number of oxygen\u2019s that were 
getting desorbs as we saw in the earlier 
slide denotes oxygen can actually be lost 
here 
oxygen can be lost between these two sites 
oxygen can be lost her also So there are 
different places oxygen\u2019s can be labile 
But as you saw with each temperature region 
one particular type of oxygen is actually 
going now we will see more closely which 
of 
this oxygen\u2019s are labile and how they control 
the superconductivity 
And therefore if this is one particular unit 
cell with full composition of yttrium barium 
copper oxide and in this you can easily observe 
that this is the copper oxygen chains that 
are there These are the copper oxygen chains 
and these are the copper oxygen planes 
and their coordination is actually different 
here but what you would see that the high 
T c 
is actually controlled by the copper oxygen 
chains which are a C O type of units which 
are placed here 
This copper oxygen chains are critical to 
the high T c and no matter what happens in 
the 
copper oxygen plane it does not seem to adversely 
affect the high T c So the core of the 
superconductivity is the issue of controlling 
the oxygen stochiometry in the copper 
oxygen chains because this is your a b plane 
This is a nice view graph which will tell 
us where does the oxygen deplete in the first 
place both in the orthorhombic and tetragonal 
forms of the y The O sites as you 
would see O sites at the rarerth plan and 
the oxygen five sites at the basal plane are 
totally vacant So that\u2019s why it is denoted 
with the square here the squares indicate 
that 
these are places where oxygen\u2019s are missing 
and that is why you get a total number of 

oxygen atoms because there are enough vacant 
sites 
And in this vacancy the places where oxygen 
can be easily put and easily taken is this 
O 
vacancy the reversible intercalation of 
oxygen in O that is here and at O actually 
amounts for the physical and chemical properties 
of this yttrium barium copper oxide 
And this can be studied using temperature 
program desorption you can clearly find out 
that it is possible for us to incorporate 
oxygen in this region The moment oxygen is 
taken out of O which is your copper oxygen 
chain immediately the T c is lost 
This is another cartoon which tells us how 
critical the oxygen stochiometry is and if 
your using ammonia as a test gas for ammonia 
decomposition using yttrium barium 
copper you would find out from this plot 
a which is for YBCO compound And this is 
for the cobalt doped YBCO compound the oxygen 
depletion is somewhere around 
to degree C And this particular oxygen 
is actually coming out of the woven site 
which we saw in the previous cartoon and 
the more the lattice oxygen is actually taken 
the more the faster is the conversion of ammonia 
to nitrogen and to N O and other related 
oxides So the place where oxygen is actually 
missing comes from the copper oxygen 
chains 
And you can also find out the relative proportion 
of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide 
that is coming out there is a very steep 
increase in oxygen coming out of the yttrium 
barium copper oxide somewhere around 
degree C 
Now having said that we can actually map 
some general behaviour in all the high T c 
superconductors that are reported For example 
you take the compound Y B a C 
a O and from there you can see there 
are three other compounds which are 
mentioned those are bismuth related compounds 
but they are nevertheless cooperates 
And bismuth related compounds actually shows 
a increase in T c and if you compare the 
T c with the number of copper oxygen planes 
in the unit cell you would find out that 
with increase in the copper oxygen planes 
from to to the T c is actually increasing 
from to So this is a very clear 
proof that copper oxygen planes are very 
critical for the superconductivity so copper 
oxygen planes are very critical for 
superconductivity So when you try to make 
a material if you can make a repeat of this 
copper oxygen planes then there is a possibility 
for us to increase the T c 
But it has also been found out that the number 
of copper oxygen planes which can be 
incorporated into the stacked perovskite layer 
that T c actually seems to saturate beyond 
three So there is a limiting situation for 
such stackings because it is possible to decorate 
such perovskite interlayer\u2019s with the copper 
oxygen sheets or planes using some 
physical vapour deposition but it has been 
found that the T c does not seem to increase 
more than three copper oxygen planes 
Another group of compound that has really 
attracted interest is thallium based 
cooperates and mercury based cuperates as 
you can see the maximum has been 
achieved for mercury based cuperates which 
shows T c at K Main problem with 
bismuth thallium and mercury is that they 
really evaporate therefore you can end up 
with the non stochiometric or nonchemically 
homogeneous compound 
So most of the reactions that are done here 
is actually achieved in sealed tube 
conditions and that imposes a problem of 
making this in bulk and that\u2019s why yttrium 
barium copper is still preferred for practical 
application because you do not have 
stringent requirements in terms of synthesizing 
this you can just do it in open air And 
you can make it in kilogram quantities or 
gram quantities which is not a problem 
therefore although these superconductors 
do hold a potential because of their high 
T c 
but because of the processing limitations 
the applications are very few 
And this is typically the unit cell of your 
mercury based mercury or thallium based 
superconductors you can see here again the 
copper oxygen planes which actually control 
the superconductivity And in between if you 
can actually incorporate a copper oxygen 
plane then the T c actually can be modified 
And the typically for a mercury based superconductor 
the T c can be seen here and they 
have very high critical current density of 
power ampere per centimetre square and 
the T c is somewhere around Kelvin 
As I told you these are perovskite blocks 
which can be modified so if you can this 
is a 
illuminate block and the rock salt block 
illuminate block So it is very easy for 
us to 
incorporate copper oxygen sheets in between 
to increase the superconductivity and 
therefore many compositions have been reported 
for thallium and bismuth based 
compounds 
Coming to the phase diagram then we can understand 
how critical the doping 
concentration is as I told you lanthanum 
I will write it here lanthanum two minus 
x S r 
x C O actually has the critical concentration 
of strontium So if you actually make a 
substitution of strontium in the lanthanum 
site then you can look at the T c maxima 
and 
you would find out the T c is maximum only 
for a critical composition of say 
Beyond that if we keep doping then the superconductivity 
actually takes them so this is 
the region where you can aim at strontium 
doping 
So strontium with x is the compound 
which will actually give you maximum 
superconductivity beyond which you would 
see it is in a metallic range if it is below 
then it is in a semiconducting like state 
So this is critical for us to understand 
what 
is the compositional limit because in strontium 
content if you increase you can see that 
it 
is fully oxygenated And therefore the oxygen 
vacancies are at it is maximum 
somewhere around this region 
And this is critical for high T c and you 
would also find out somewhere around this 
the 
nominal composition of your copper valency 
or copper valence state is somewhere 
around or which means copper is actually 
having both copper and some 
amount is partially substituted with copper 
plus and that is coming because of oxygen 
deficiency to bring about the right neutrality 
charged neutrality some of the copper gets 
oxidized to copper plus 
And this is again another plot which tells 
about the oxygen content in strontium doped 
L 
a C o and you can see very well here 
that this is the superconducting region where 
the oxygen content is very close to And 
the T c at is at it is maxima if you actually 
bring down either way then the T c falls rapidly 
and it goes into a non superconducting 
state So the incorporation of oxygen in 
all this cuperates is very critical and that 
governs also partially the oxidation state 
of copper copper which is actually a 
affecting the copper in the copper oxygen 
chain which is in the a b plane 
And here again the we see a several other 
ways that we can enhance the T c for all this 
compounds that we see here yttrium barium 
copper or bismuth based or mercury based 
or thallium based We can actually try to 
maximize on the T c by applying pressure 
this 
is not various chemical pressure effect this 
is a physical pressure effect by which we 
can 
enhance the T c 
And here thallium based compound is same 
here and this is a three dimensional plot 
of 
T c versus composition of yttrium versus pressure 
You can see only at critical 
compositions you can get a maximum T c 
Lastly I just would like to bring to your 
focus that this is one the recent discovery 
although it is years old but this is again 
a serendipity where magnesium dibromide 
has been found to show superconductivity 
at nearly K And this is a black compound 
incidentally the group which was working in 
Japan they did not have the proper starting 
material to synthesis one of the superconducting 
compound When they found 
magnesium diboride in the shelf and they just 
took that and studied they found that this 
diboride also shows a superconductivity Therefore 
the game has always been a 
serendipity as far as this superconductivity 
is concerned 
And this is the T c curve which clearly shows 
a K super conductor for magnesium 
boride 
And mechanism it is based on metallic conduction 
you would see electrons are going 
through the lattice with minimum scattering 
But what really governs the superconductivity 
is the formation of cooper pairs and this 
cooper pairs really govern the issue of superconductivity 
And how does this copper pair formation occurs 
cooper pair is nothing but two electrons 
going hand in hand they are running through 
the channels and they induce a super 
current And this formation of copper pair 
is actually facilitated by the lattice contraction 
here these are your atoms and when there 
is a distortion in the lattice Then a cooper 
pair 
is actually formed the two electrons called 
the cooper pair belong becomes locked 
together as they proceed through the lattice 
which gives us strong super current 
And this is actually confined in the copper 
oxygen chain which is the cause 
And one way to identify how this differs from 
a normal metal is there is no band gap in 
this case whereas in the superconducting 
case because a cooper pair has to form there 
is 
a opening of band gap which is called E g 
Refer Slide Time 
And that is once it is taken care then you 
can get the super conducting states So 
compared to a normal metal how do we identify 
a superconductor because this amount of 
delta is actually a narrow band gap opening 
which is the binding energy of the cooper 
pair Once one this is formed then the binding 
energy of the cooper pair will sustain the 
super current So the opening of band gap 
between the valance and conduction band 
compared to a normal metal is the in essence 
the mechanism for superconductor 
And as you would see here the spin up and 
spin down bands are given here spin up spin 
down bands and in a normal metal both at 
v is equal to and v is when potential is 
supplied You would see there is a very small 
variation between the majority and 
minority spins whereas in a superconducting 
state you would see that this is varying 
The spin up and the spin down band they open 
up a band gap and that will actually give 
you band gap of this order which will be 
the binding energy for the cooper pairs So 
in a 
typical situation you I V curve for a metal 
will look like this whereas for a 
superconductor you would see 
a opening up of a band gap that would determine 
whether 
this cooper pair can be formed 
Applications of superconductor I will just 
finish with few mention 
One of the important application is in the 
field of medical imaging this is a MRI scan 
where a superconductor is actually used for 
MRI\u2019s And not only that superconductor 
can be made as a real this 
is a tape they call it in this rolling assisted 
texture tapes you 
will see 
the superconductor can be coated And therefore 
we 
can try to render this 
superconductor not just as a bulk material 
but also in tape form 
And it is also used in Josephson junction 
And that\u2019s where the principle of NMR application 
is used where squid is actually 
this is 
nothing but superconducting quantum interferon 
device which is actually used for 
measuring very small changes in 
the magnetic filed in local environment Therefore 
this 
is 
actually used in NMR 
And lastly as I told you the floating train 
The trains run without wheels and this is 
already experimented between two states in 
USA and this is a unmanned train which 
travels at 
the rate of kilometres per hour where 
Meissner effect or the magnetic 
levitation is actually used to demonstrate 
this effect 

' ] [ u'In the last lectures we have been looking 
at the issue of Spintronic Materials and what 
makes inorganic solids more attractive mainly 
because in the presence and absence of 
magnetic field you see large changes in the 
resistance And to give a classic example 
we 
have discussed about manganite chemistry and 
how in a simple lattice you have 
ferromagnetic structures which can be fine 
tuned to alter the electronics properties 
In other words we see a large change in the 
resistance in the by the influence of 
magnetic field which brings about a huge 
drop in resistance which we call it as colossal 
magnetoresistance Also in metallic samples 
we have discussed how the interfaces can 
help in ordering ferromagnetic compounds 
in both ferromagnetic way and in 
antiferromagnetic way and thereby affecting 
the electronic properties Another group of 
compounds have attracted interest and this 
is also under the broader area of spin 
electronics spintronics and this is called 
as dilute magnetic semiconductors 
We all know that semiconductor industry is 
mainly governed by silicon technology and 
there are lot of additions to silicon technology 
which has come up in the last 
decades Therefore in semiconductor industry 
can there be anything new that can come 
out other than the existing silicon based 
technology 
The most prominently used material other than 
silicon is gallium arsenide but it is a very 
expensive technology because you can not accommodate 
any amount of oxygen as a 
impurity therefore this technology is a very 
very touchy or very sensitive technology 
So mostly the semiconductor technology involves 
high vacuum and in conditions which 
is normally not exercised for other compounds 
that are used in functional applications 
So if we can bring about a magnetic signature 
in a typical semiconductor will that affect 
the semiconductor technology is the question 
Today I am going to take you through some 
course of slides where I am going to show 
you specific examples where compounds which 
were originally thought to be 
semiconducting if it is transformed to a 
magnetic semiconductor or if we can induce 
semiconducting property What are the implications 
and how we can understand that and 
also I will give some examples of slightly 
higher band gap materials other than the 
typical semiconductors and show how magnetic 
properties can be governed and studied 
in those 
Now to quickly take you through some of the 
basic definitions and then some examples 
which will form the case for today\xe2\u20ac\u2122s lecture 
let me ask this question what are these dilute 
magnetic semiconductors These semiconductors 
they make use of both charge and spin 
of electrons and there by magnetic elements 
can be introduced to bring about a situation 
where a semiconductor which is nonmagnetic 
can become magnetic semiconductor 
So precisely this cartoon will tell us what 
such a situation is this is a typical 
nonmagnetic semiconductor where the semiconductor 
material is arranged in a periodic 
lattice And suppose I am going to add some 
transition metal ions into this 
semiconductor then one can see that these 
sort of magnetic impurities can be 
accommodated in the crystal lattice and they 
are in fact ordered And in such situation 
you end up with paramagnetic dilute magnetic 
semiconductors because these ions are 
magnetic but they are oriented in different 
fashion 
Now what is important is the crystal lattice 
still remains the same we are not disturbing 
the lattice and classic example is that of 
a semiconductor Some of the known ones 
are gallium arsenide and this is a typical 
magnetic semiconductor which is a gadolinium 
sulfide but the most prevalent one is gallium 
arsenide Now if the same paramagnetic D 
M S compound we can try to induce some holes 
and if we can induce some holes here 
in this structure 
Those holes will actually turn these paramagnetic 
signatures to a concerted 
ferromagnetic signal thereby we translate 
a paramagnetic dilute magnetic semiconductor 
to a ferromagnetic dilute magnetic semiconductor 
So issues are there take a 
semiconductor and transition metal ions and 
if you can engineer some holes if you can 
add some holes and these holes will stabilize 
the paramagnetic stuff to a ferromagnetic 
stuff So in essence you will see a concerted 
magnetic movement or a total magnetic 
moment which is prevalent even at room temperature 
So this is a example of a dilute 
magnetic semiconductor it was reported by 
ohno and coworkers in science magazine in 

Now questions that remain to be answered 
here is if manganese is doped in gallium 
arsenide in which the magnetic domain dopant 
provides a magnetic moment then a spin 
polarized charge also comes into picture 
because the carrier is now having a spin 
memory and this can actually bring about a 
new phase of spintronic materials 
So transition metal ion doped in a semiconductor 
matrix will induce a magnetic 
moment and there by provide a spin polarized 
charge carrier which brings about a spin 
a 
spintronic material 
But there are some primary questions that 
we need to address what is this question 
what are the states of manganese what is 
the oxidation state are the manganese states 
localized or they are strongly hybridized 
with the gallium arsenide valence band It 
can 
stand a aloof or it can actually hybridize 
with the gallium arsenide valence band and 
otherwise they can form a separate impurity 
band 
If they form a separate impurity band then 
you can not call this as a dilute magnetic 
semiconductor it has to mingle itself with 
the valence band of the host material 
therefore it is very important to understand 
where this manganese is going Because 
you are trying to dope to the tune of percent 
to percent not more than that because it 
has to be dilute 
Now in such concentration where is your 
manganese and what is the nature of this 
manganese is the question now to understand 
this sophisticated techniques such as xray 
absorption spectroscopy and X M C D that 
is xray magnetic circular dichroism 
These are some of the refined techniques 
that are used to see whether it is truly 
a 
magnetic signal or not or whether it is coming 
from a impurity induced magnetic 
signature So these are synchrotron based 
analysis which can give you precise idea 
about what is the nature of the interactions 
in this compound 
This cartoon will tell us what exactly the 
signature of manganese doped gallium 
arsenide is in the top figure we see the 
manganese L edge of the absorption spectra 
this is from the xray absorption spectra 
Now you can actually make this compound 
which is manganese doped gallium arsenide 
and you can look at the manganese L H 
and you can do that in ways one is magnetization 
In the you can actually try to probe 
this in different directions one is parallel 
and antiparallel alignment of polarization 
and 
when the magnetization is aligned in 
that is this curve and the magnetization 
when 
it is aligned in direction that is 
in this curve green curve 
So if you clearly see that in directions 
and in direction you see that 
there 
is a huge drop in the intensity in other 
words they features xray absorption features 
are 
radically different when you try to take 
the X M C D sorry xray absorption spectra 
of 
the manganese feature And in the plane of 
magnetization out of plane of magnetization 
as a result what happens you can clearly 
see that it is magnetized the lattice is 
magnetic 
as a result there is change in the xray 
absorption structural feature 
So this is one signature that can tell us 
that it is truly magnetic suppose manganese 
is 
not doped then you would see both the intensities 
in and they will be 
actually the same So this is one signature 
in the other one you can see X M C D xray 
magnetic circular dichroism for magnetization 
along that is black here and the one 
in green is in the plane 
The pronounced differences between the absorption 
spectra and the observed anisotropy 
in the features in the X M C D are most remarkable 
you can clearly see in this region 
that the intensity of the features in both 
and plane clearly shows that 
there is 
a remarkable change in the X C M D 
And this work was actually reported by edmonds 
and coworkers which is also published 
in P R L in the year Now if you make 
the X M C D if you take the X M C D and 
try to make a plot against the angle of rotation 
then you can see the dependence of X M 
C D signal for the out of plane and in plane 
as a function of angle theta And you can 
clearly see that the open circles which 
represents the angular dependence in 
plane 
and the solid symbols indicates the results 
in plane 
So in the plane you do not you see 
between here and here there is a angel of 
rotation which means there is a magnetic 
signature which is intrinsic of the manganese 
doped gallium arsenide And the same is true 
if you look at look at the X M C D features 
here the hall measurements clearly show that 
there is a change in the hall mobility or 
the hole density as we take the signature 
from the X M C D results 
What does this mean there is a angle dependent 
xray magnetic circular dichroism 
which clearly shows that when manganese is 
doped in gallium arsenide there is a 
definite magnetic signature coming Now so 
what do we understand about this dilute 
magnetic semiconductors 
These are semiconductors that are doped with 
magnetic ions the interaction among these 
spins lead to a magnetic state the charge 
of the electron enables semiconductors to 
processes information And the spin allows 
to realize magnetic information for storage 
devices these type of materials have a lattice 
structure similar to that of undoped 
semiconductor 
So one of the main thing that one would 
required or one would look for is the single 
phase xray single phase that has to be 
present not only xray single phase the it 
should 
be also magnetically a single phase material 
Because you are dealing with the very 
small doping and in such situations you may 
not be able to trace the impurity ion in 
from the xray because it is very very low 
Therefore you need to know whether it is 
magnetically a single phase and structurally 
a single phase 
There are several examples that can suggest 
how tricky this situation can become but 
before that what one slide I would like to 
show what is the implication of this dilute 
magnetic semiconductor The possible application 
is it would create a revolutionary new 
class of electronic based on the spin degree 
of the freedom of the electron in addition 
to 
the charge 
So far the semiconductor devices they are 
more concerned with the charge of the 
electron now if you bring about a spin ferromagnetic 
spin into this then you can 
actually translate this into a single integration 
on a single chip which will comprise of 
both the semiconducting property and the magnetic 
property And therefore you can 
bring about a new possibilities in spintronics 
this was reported by zutic in review of 
modern physics in for a better understanding 
on all the possible applications of 
this 
Now another question that we can ask about 
the usefulness of this spin and charge in 
dilute magnetic semiconductors when will 
this finally be as easy as switching on the 
light is it a near possibility or a distant 
reality that one can hope for many people 
keep 
asking this question and whether this can 
be ably applied to our computer technology 
in 
these days And specially because this can 
affect the random access memory this has 
a 
direct implication the answer that we can 
saym as of now based on the results that 
we 
have that using this spin and charge in semiconductor 
industry is not too far 
So why there is such a great interest in 
these materials because in year dietail 
and 
coworkers they reported using theoretical 
predictions they run through several of the 
semiconducting materials and they try to predict 
if there is a possibility of looking for 
new materials In such case you start first 
with silicon which is our reference point 
compare to silicon you have semiconductors 
or semiconductors or 
semiconductors 
You can see aluminum phosphide aluminum arsenide 
gallium phosphide gallium 
arsenide indium phosphide indium arsenide 
all these combinations are somewhere close 
to silicon These are the theoretical predictions 
indicating that they can turn 
ferromagnetic Now notably if you see we 
are somewhere around this region of room 
temperature if we have to realize a room 
temperature ferromagnetic situation then 

compounds really cross this line and those 
are gallium nitride and another one is 
astonishingly zinc oxide both these compounds 
are known to be ferromagnetic or it is 
calculated to show that they possess a definite 
magnetic moment beyond room 
temperature So therefore the target molecules 
or the target compounds which have 
been studied in the recent past or the substituted 
gallium nitride materials and also zinc 
oxide There are other ones based on zinc 
compounds which are the zinc chalcogenides 
namely telluride and selenide they also show 
magnetic property 
But never the less the once which are around 
the room temperature carries our attention 
therefore I will try to show in the next 
few slides the some of the research that 
has gone 
into several of these oxides or non oxide 
base compounds And we will try to understand 
how we can clearly escape from the situation 
where we realize a impurity induced 
ferromagnetic compound And we will also try 
to see what are all the characterization 
facilities that are available for us to go 
into microscopic details to find out whether 
they 
are truly magnetic signatures are they are 
impurity induced ones 
To start with let me show an example of zhu 
and coworkers who reported this compound 
nickel doped titania and this was reported 
in A P l in you can see here they have 
formed using ion beam implantation technique 
They have tried to dope nickel in 
titanium matrix and this is the T E M picture 
which clearly shows that this is a 
amorphous titania matrix because you can 
see there is no order there and in this 
there 
are submerged nickel clusters or nickel particles 
And these are of the order of say nanometer 
or so roughly they are of nanometer 
nickel particles which are actually embedded 
in titanium matrix in such case what will 
happen you will see the magnetic signature 
very clearly you see a signature at K 
And this should have actually blown up but 
what you see here even at a K you do 
not see a very clear change in the hysteresis 
but a very feeble hysteresis is developing 
at 
low temperature This was the first report 
on nickel doped T i O and in this case you 
see that nickel seems to be in the nickel 
state as a nickel metallic cluster it is 
not a 
nickel substituted in T i O 
Otherwise another example that was reported 
by matsumoto in and what did they 
do they have doped cobalt in T i O because 
T i O is also a band gap material wide 
band gap material And if you clearly look 
at the X R D pattern of percent cobalt 
doped in T i O you can clearly see the 
peaks of anatase T i O only with no impurity 
peaks So if you look at the cobalt signature 
you would see that it is epitaxially 
growing and there is no signature of cobalt 
crystallizing out in any other form So 
in 
that case you can look at the high resolution 
T M also we do not seemingly see any sort 
of change in the interface it is nicely growing 
on L a A l O substrate but never the 
less we do not have any clear idea where 
this magnetic signal is coming from 
If you look at the magnetic signature M versus 
H plot clearly shows at room temperature 
for a percent cobalt doped one you clearly 
see this hysteresis loop coming and if you 
are going to sweep the M versus T plot for 
the same percent cobalt doped T i O you 
can clearly see that there is the ferromagnetic 
transition is beyond a room temperature 
So just for percent cobalt doped in T i 
O you see the T c is above room temperature 
and there is no signal of any cobalt crystallizing 
out 
If you look at this cobalt doped zinc oxide 
for a change you would see the X P S that 
is 
xray photoelectron spectroscopy results 
which was reported in a series of sample 
if you 
look at the cobalt P by and cobalt 
P half you see a X P S feature which is 
with 
very fine features You would be tempted to 
say is that cobalt is nicely doped in zinc 
oxide but if you carefully look at the signature 
you would find for a nanometer 
sputtered film 
If you deconvolute these features and if you 
deconvolute these features you would find 
that cobalt plus is definitely there which 
means it is clearly substituted in Z N O 
this 
is zinc oxide And you would also see the 
cobalt plus satellite features here these 
are 
the satellite features now along with that 
you also see a clear feature coming for C 
o 
which is metallic In other words you have 
apart from cobalt getting doped in the Z N 
O 
you also have a proportion of cobalt which 
is staying as a metallic cluster 
So in this case what you would clearly understand 
is the magnetic signature although it 
can come from substituted cobalt which can 
be doped in the valence band region of 
your zinc oxide lattice There is a clear 
possibility of metallic cobalt contributing 
to the 
magnetic property So this is very important 
and we 
need to be extremely careful that 
the magnetic signatures what we observe is 
actually coming from the doped situation 
and not from the metallic clusters 
If you take for example another high band 
gap material like H f O which is doped 
with nickel and this can be achieved by pulsed 
laser deposition technique you would see 
that the magnetic moment for the Y S Z that 
is the substrate substrate is almost 
showing a very very weak magnetic moment 
of the order of power minus e m u 
And if you dope if you take the raw data 
of the nickel doped one you see there is 
a 
remarkable jump in the feature and if you 
try to subtract the background then you can 
see the film is actually contributing something 
like this 
Now between the substrate and the nickel 
doped sample the difference is only in this 
value never the less it is a very small 
feature and therefore you need to look at 
the M 
versus H feature you can see that in the 
parallel and perpendicular geometry there 
is a 
change If in parallel and perpendicular 
there is a change then we can say that nickel 
is 
doped inside H f O therefore you can say 
that the ferromagnetism is originating from 
the doped matrix rather than from any type 
of clusters this was reported by hong 
coworkers in In A P l 
Cobalt doped H f O this also can be prepared 
from pulsed laser deposition you can 
clearly see that this is clearly a doped 
situation because if you look at the xray 
of the 
thin film which is deposited in Y S Z These 
are the Y S Z xray features and along with 
that comes the reflection for H f O this 
peak is for H f O and this peak is also 
for H f 
O which is and features they 
nicely grow on Y S Z film 
Now if you look carefully at this deviation 
if you look carefully at this peak now you 
would find out that between the doped and 
the undoped this is the cobalt doped and 
this 
is the undoped There is a clear deviation 
in the xray pattern showing that when you 
doped cobalt then there is a shift which means 
cobalt is substituted in H f O matrix as 
a result whatever magnetic feature that is 
coming whether it is percent or percent 
or 
percent you see a systematic increase in 
the moment of this cobalt doped H f O 
compound 
So one can say that there is a possibility 
of doping this material in H f O but we 
need 
to also understand where this magnetic signatures 
are coming it is proved that the 
ferromagnetism is attributed to formation 
of a cobalt rich surface layer because if 
you do 
the eels as a function of the thickness of 
your H f O So you have your Y S Z here 
Y S 
Z substrate and if you have your H f O 
thin film and if you keep on doing the eels 
study across this thickness as you go towards 
the surface of this layer as you go to this 
surface 
You see the cobalt magnitude or the amount 
of cobalt is actually increasing the intensity 
of the cobalt peak is increasing as you go 
towards the surface of the H f O peak 
Therefore it was a concluded that it is not 
purely a dilute magnetic semiconductor rather 
it is coming from a rich cobalt surface layer 
which is contributing towards the magnetic 
property 
If you take another example this is a another 
classic example of a wide band gap 
material M g o which is having a band gap 
above electron volt And in this case if 
you 
are going to dope nickel then you can see 
that there is a paramagnetic signal which 
is 
superimposed on the ferromagnetic signal 
Mainly because this is seen at K and this 
is seen at a low temperature substitution 
as well as presence of nickel clusters lead 
to 
ferromagnetism at room temperature 
So the at the microscopic level if you look 
at the magnetic feature it looks as though 
you have a very strong ferromagnetic signature 
But if you clearly probe it these are 
specially at low temperatures you could see 
that there is a paramagnetic signature which 
is coupled with a ferromagnetic signature 
and this was reported by Ramachandran in 

And if that is a case then if you make a plot 
of magnetization versus temperature you 
would see if there is a sudden upsurge in 
the magnetic moment at low temperatures then 
the indication is this is due to substitution 
And the paramagnetic behavior in the case 
of 
substitution comes at low temperature 
So with all these confusions around we do 
not know whether the magnetic signature in 
this sort of wide range of semiconductors 
that I have been studied whether the magnetic 
information that we are getting is truly 
coming from a doped semiconductor or it is 
coming from a impurity induced magnetic property 
If it is induced then it is of no use 
for the spintronic property therefore we 
need to be extra careful to know whether 
the 
magnetic information is a true phenomena or 
it is a impurity induced phenomena 
because in the past it has been observed 
when you are doing magnetic study 
Even if you are going to pickup these materials 
with a nickels spatula or a iron spatula 
or iron forceps even though small impurities 
can induce quite a lot of signature 
Specially because the sort of magnetic signal 
that you are seeing in a thin film situation 
is of the order of power minus e m u 
you have to be very very careful where these 
signatures are coming from 
So to elucidate this it is possible for 
us to study a different sort of compounds 
to say 
what could happen if there if it is a transition 
metal cluster induced ferromagnetism and 
what would be the signature if it is truly 
a ferromagnetic situation So for this reason 
we can actually try to induce magnetism in 
wide band gap oxides by doping transition 
metals we can try to do that by doping nickel 
cobalt iron in ceramic oxides like 
zirconia ceria and alumina I may not be 
able to run through all these examples 
But I will certainly try in the next few 
slides to show you what will happen if you 
have 
nickel cobalt and iron doped in zirconia 
and try to understand what is the magnetic 
signature that we can look for if you try 
to dope it in a wide band gap material In 
fact 
zirconia is not just a semiconductor we can 
classify this even as a insulator because 
the 
band gap is more than e v And we can try 
to see if we can achieve room temperature 
ferromagnetism in this high K dielectric ceramic 
oxides and we can see whether this can 
be used for potential applications in spintronic 
technology 
Now why we are choosing nickel cobalt and 
iron based Z r O because they form a 
very important class of compounds called cermets 
cermets is nothing but a ceramic and 
a metal composite ceramic metal composite 
which is known for more than decades 
now And these are used for mechanical applications 
because zirconia when it is doped 
with any transition metal it improves the 
mechanical strength by orders Therefore 
intentionally people dope this transition 
metals including molybdenum people have 
used it and this comes under special category 
called cermets 
So cermets are nothing but ceramic metal 
composites and the optimal properties that 
you can achieve is one is it is a ceramic 
So you have a high temperature resistance 
and 
one is you have a metal you have the ability 
to go through plastic deformation So 
plugged in you have in where a metal 
is actually interspersed in a ceramic metal 
which will add strength to the to the material 
but we are going to use such a ceramet 
composition to study the magnetic information 
in these oxides 
The metallic elements used as I told you are 
nickel molybdenum and cobalt cermets can 
also be made with a with a concentration 
of percent metal by volume and cermets 
are 
used in the manufacture of resistors capacitors 
and other electronic components which 
may experience high temperature So these 
are the fundamental use of the cermets but 
what we are going to do is use this cermet 
compounds to see whether we can understand 
little bit on the magnetic signature 
So how do we do this because zirconia is 
a material which is a high temperature 
material therefore you need very high temperatures 
to prepare these compounds We are 
going to show how using wet chemical routes 
one can prepare these oxides and there is 
no need even to make thin films using costly 
methods like P L D or M B E And these 
materials can be prepared at a very faster 
rate and we can achieve even high temperature 
phases by nonconventional routes 
I will show or examples of how using microwave 
combustion route we can prepare 
these compounds microwave assisted combustion 
route can form a very useful route to 
prepare this sort of high temperature oxides 
And in the module one in on wet chemical routes 
I have already discussed with you the 
use of microwave combustion the main advantage 
of microwave combustion is you try 
to generate high temperatures from within 
the sample instead of supplying heat to the 
sample So this is the conventional electro 
heating method where as this is the 
microwave heating method 
And the reason why we can use microwave is 
you are actually starting with some 
material which is made of nitrate and fuel 
which is urea and these are materials which 
have very high dielectric constant therefore 
they absorb the microwave much more 
easily due to a mechanism called dipolar 
polarization As a result you can initiate 
combustion reactions within the sample which 
can easily lead to a one step 
decomposition straight to metal oxide 
So therefore if you have to prepare zirconia 
at even degree C you can achieve that 
in a using a just a microwave in other words 
a furnaceless technique can be used to 
initiate high temperature reactions where 
you can make metal oxide So let us say that 
metal oxides are made out of this reaction 
then we need to look at the purity and then 
we 
need to look at the magnetic signature that 
we are going to see in this compound 
So we will first start with nickel doped 
zirconia powders and try to see if we use 
combustion synthesis to prepare 
What are the magnetic signatures in this and 
this is just the residual analysis for percent 
and percent doped compounds You can see 
clearly that the xray pattern X R D 
pattern that we see for percent nickel 
doped and percent nickel doped samples 
Clearly show that the xray pattern resembles 
that of cubic zirconia if it is going to 
be 
monoclinic which is another phase which 
is reported to be stable at room temperature 
then you would see signature of the monoclinic 
phases coming somewhere here 
But one would clearly see that there are 
no features of monoclinic picks present in 
the 
samples clearly showing that just using a 
simple technique one can prepare cubic 
zirconia Now we do not have to just limit 
with percent and percent which is of 
interest for our D M S study one can even 
go to percent or and we can go even 
up 
to percent And try to see in the cermet 
compositions where exactly nickel oxide 
impurity peak is coming as you see here 
percent peak we do not we still see zirconia 
in cubic phase 
And if you go to percent you do 
not see any trace of monoclinic phase coming 
here so this is still in cubic but what 
you would you see here above percent 
small 
peaks are coming these are the nickel oxides 
peaks So these nickel oxides peaks have 
started coming beyond percent therefore 
if we need to look at the magnetic phases 
one can say that safely up to percent 
we can keep looking at these magnetic 
signatures carefully and try to understand 
whether they are impurity induced or they 
are 
coming from substituted ferromagnetism 
You can see in the first view graph of this 
magnetic signature for a percent nickel 
doped zirconia very clearly there is a hysteresis 
loop emerging at K and at K 
Now to make sure that this is not coming 
from zirconia itself because zirconia is 
actually a oxygen scavenger in other words 
it can easily form Z r minus delta or plus 
delta because zirconia takes carries a electron 
and it can give electron and as a result it 
is 
also known as fast ion conductor But what 
is important here is any amount of excess 
oxygen is present it can easily go into the 
Z r o lattice 
So if we should make sure that the magnetic 
signature is not exactly coming from 
oxygen stoichiometry So if you look at the 
parent compound parent compound clearly 
shows a negative trend in the M versus H curve 
showing that it is nonmagnetic so any 
signature that is coming is actually coming 
from nickel doping only So for one percent 
nickel doping you can clearly see it is showing 
a room temperature ferromagnetism and 
if it is room temperature ferromagnetic system 
then one would typically see that the 
coercivity value is increasing and the moment 
is increasing if we measure it at K 
But what we see here is more of a paramagnetic 
signature which is coming like this for 
K indicating there is a paramagnetic 
component associated with the ferromagnetic 
impurity at percent nickel doping And you 
can see this is clearly blown to show how 
the coercivity is varying with the temperature 
So definitely there is some possibility of 
inducing ferromagnetism at this stage 
Now if you go to percent nickel doping 
you can see that it is not showing any more 
of the paramagnetic signature at K and 
there is a definite change in the hysteresis 
and 
hysteresis loop clearly shows that there 
is a strong ferromagnetism that is induced 
into 
this zirconia matrix And just to make sure 
that we are still playing in the safe domain 
you see that the Z r O which is undoped 
is showing a negative magnetization slope 
therefore whatever is seen here is actually 
coming from nickel doping 
So you can actually run through from percent 
you can go up to percent of nickel 
and try to see what is happening you can 
see that the M s value is actually increasing 
up to percent and beyond percent suddenly 
you see the magnetization is 
decreasing Why it is happening I have already 
shown that beyond percent nickel 
oxide starts precipitating out and we can 
try we can based on the magnetic signature 
then you can try to look at the boar magneton 
In terms of formula unit in terms of nickel 
atom you can see that there is a progressive 
increase in this case and then it falls back 
and then again it increases therefore there 
are 
some safe domains where we can look for magnetism 
that is truly coming from nickel 
doping And there are some domains where 
it is coming from the segregated phases 
We can see that from this sum up of results 
in percent clearly shows a ferromagnetic 
loop at a room temperature this we have seen 
And if you increase the nickel 
concentration you can clearly see that the 
magnetization is systematically increasing 
but for percent suddenly it is dropping 
down So that means nickel keeps on going 
but if you make a plot of magnetization as 
a function of nickel concentration you would 
see that there is a region where the slope 
is only marginal or we can say it is linear 
here 
may be even up to this place 
And then suddenly the linearity goes this 
way and then it drops down so we can actually 
say that there are regions in nickel doping 
as a function of magnetization a region 
from says to may be percent is region 
and beyond percent you see a increase 
in the magnetization and then it again falls 
down So we can sort of propose a tentative 
magnetic phase diagram saying that if at 
all we are looking for a dilute magnetic 
semiconductor then this is the region which 
we can look for where it is safely nickel 
which is clearly substituted into the Z r 
O matrix 
And beyond that in this is a cermets region 
where nickel is actually precipitating out 
as 
nickel clusters and those clusters are embedded 
in Z r O matrix as a result you clearly 
see with more and more of nickel nickel coming 
out as nickel metallic nickel there is a 
increase in the magnetization So if you 
look at this magnetic phase diagram we can 
clearly say that if we are talking anywhere 
about a possibility of a dilute magnetic 
semiconductor situation then we should only 
be talking about to less than percent 
phase where you can clearly substitute nickel 
in Z r O matrix 
We can clearly see that from the T E M pictures 
also this is for percent nickel what 
you would see here is a polycrystalline feature 
but you do not see any sort of nickel or 
nickel oxide phase coming in one percent 
But in percent nickel you see a small 
feature of nickel oxide which is precipitating 
out this is clearly evident from the T E 
M 
results So we can say that even between 
to percent 
There is a safe compositional limit where 
we have to restrict for a dilute magnetic 
semiconductor and if you go further your T 
E M clearly shows that for and 
percent there is a clear signature of nickel 
oxide that is coming out And these particles 
for example if you map it these are suppose 
to be nickel oxide which is actually 
showing the sort of nickel oxide features 
in the electron diffraction pattern So you 
have 
a increase in the magnetic moment but the 
magnetic moment is essentially coming from 
nickel metal rather than nickel substitution 
And this we can see from the ferromagnetic 
resonance as well you can clearly see for 

and percent there is a systematic change 
in the magnetic resonance therefore there 
is a 
clear possibility of a D M S that is in picture 
And how do we know in a macroscopic 
way we can even look at the powders the 
morphology of the powders the moment you 
doped nickel you can see zirconia particles 
totally the morphology transforms in a very 
different way when you dope even or percent 
of nickel 
And then these are the X P S studies for 
percent nickel clearly shows there is no 
satellite feature which means there is only 
oxygen species there Suppose there is 
Z r 
O and then nickel oxide then both will 
actually show different oxygen peaks so 
we 
can clearly say that there is one only phase 
and therefore there is no asymmetry in the 
oxygen one is oxygen peak And here again 
if you see the nickel P by and nickel 

P by peaks for and percent of nickel 
there is no satellite features in the nickel 

P 
Therefore we can clearly say that nickel 
is there only in one oxidation state which 
means nickel is in nickel plus only Same 
is true if we take cobalt case cobalt is 
another ferromagnetic ion which can be doped 
as you can clearly see whether it is 
percent percent or percent it is absolutely 
a clean Z r O cubic phase 
And you do not see any sort of impurity that 
is induced here and you can also see the 
magnetic moment is increasing as a function 
of cobalt therefore there is a clear 
possibility of a D M S phase that is emerging 
out against a undoped situation 
Therefore even cobalt seems to through a 
possibility for a clear dilute magnetic 
semiconductor situation and as I told you 
earlier the cobalt substitution can be 
pronounced in the morphology compared to Z 
r O 
You can see that cobalt is literally changing 
the morphology and if you keep substituting 
cobalt to higher percentage even up to 
percent unlike the nickel case you can see 
here that you have a clean zirconia phase 
that is coming but beyond percent you 
can see that cobalt oxide phase that is C 
o O is coming And it is becoming more 
prominent and when you substitute for percent 
the system instead of increasing in 
crystallinity you can see as you would keep 
doping cobalt the crystallinity dampens and 
then you almost get a amorphous phase 
So cobalt seems to be getting substituted 
in the zirconia lattice and there is no signature 
of C o which is a magnetic phase which 
is present anywhere in the xray therefore 
we can say that the magnetic signature if 
at all anything is there it is not coming 
from 
any of the oxide impurity of cobalt it is 
actually coming from a doped situation And 
this 
is the similar thing you know you can also 
try to sinter the same powders at a higher 
temperature to see whether xray is altering 
you do not see systematically any change 
with the sintering conditions 
And you can also see that the lattice parameters 
by and large remains the same whether 
it is a as prepared sample or sintered sample 
saying that the oxidation state of cobalt 
does not seem to vary with annealing In other 
words it says that cobalt is not just 
embedded in the matrix but it is actually 
substituted 
And you can also see from these cartoons 
whether it is as prepared samples or whether 
it is sintered at degree C you can see 
the clear trend in the magnetic property 
Initially it is low and then it picks up 
just like the way we saw in nickel there 
is a 
increase up to percent and then there 
is a drop drop is actually coming from this 
drop in moment is coming from impurities of 
cobalt oxide 
So what we can see from this cobalt substituted 
compounds beyond percent you can 
see that the ferromagnetic signature shows 
that if you sweep magnetization as a function 
of temperature they all show a study temperature 
independent variation showing that 
the T C is above K in all these compositions 
So these signatures may come from 
cobalt metallic clusters whereas D M S phase 
is possible less in less than percent 
cobalt doping 
So we 
can see this trend even as we sweep through 
this 
I have already shown you the phase diagram 
and if you can see the T E M features even 
up to percent sorry even up to percent 
of cobalt doping You would see there is 
no signature of cobalt oxide coming it is 
a clean Z r O phase which means cobalt 
is 
substituted and once you go beyond that you 
can see the cobalt phase is coming ok 
So I will quickly go through the last example 
to show what exactly we can conclude out 
of doping magnetic property in this Z r O 
matrix let us take the a example of iron 
Now if you dope iron carefully only in low 
concentration limits say up to percent 

and percent you can clearly see it is 
again showing clean say Z r O cubic phase 
Now once you look at the magnetic property 
you see that the magnetization steadily 
increasing but the clue whether it is really 
coming from doped situation or from any 
other impurity comes from mossbauer 
You can see for example here in this case 
it is actually percent this is percent 
and 
this is percent this is at Kelvin and 
this is at room temperature One would clearly 
see that for percent you only see the 
doublet here you only see the doublet in 
this 
case where as you go to percent you can 
see that this doublet is getting split into 
a 
and more so in percent 
And similar feature is seen even in the 
Kelvin recorded mass per peak what we can 
say is if there is a doublet then iron is 
actually isolated There is no iron iron interaction 
in this case whereas in the case of and 
percent we seemingly find F e O 
impurities which are creeping up that is 
why for and percent you can see a sextet 
feature is coming for the iron 
So safely we can say what is the compositional 
limit that we can look for again you see 
for percent or percent and percent 
The radically the morphology is changing 
so 
what do we can see for nickel cobalt and 
iron we can say that less than percent 
of this 
transition metals doped in zirconia there 
is a clear possibility of a dilute magnetic 
signature that is coming Beyond that even 
though there is a steady or there is a 
schematic trend present in the magnetic behavior 
one has to be careful that this is not 
actually the true signature that comes from 
a 
dilute magnetic phase rather it comes 
from a impurity induced phase 
So we can sort of say from this study that 
there is a possibility for a dilute magnetic 
semiconductor not only in Z n O type of compounds 
even in high band gap materials 
but we need to be very cautious about finding 
what is the limiting concentration at 
which this magnetic phase can be found out 
So with this I conclude and we can look 
into this aspect later so make some quick 
analysis 
The analysis of magnetization data suggest 
that iron induces room temperature 
ferromagnetism high temperature phase mossbauer 
study of percent shows doublet and 
the corresponding and percent show superimposed 
sextet and doublets The isomer 
shift and quadrupole moment indicate iron 
to be 
in the oxidation state to occupy 
different octahedral sites associated with 
some amount of disorder So in cases where 
we do not have a clue here is 
one classical example that we can 
use mossbauer study to 
elucidate what is a limiting compensation 
at which we 
can realize dilute magnetic 
phase I stop here and 
we will continue in 
the next lecture 

' ] [ u'In the last lectures we have been looking 
at the issue of Magnetoresistance and any 
material which loses its resistance in the 
presence or absence of magnetic field becomes 
very interesting 
In the first example we looked at rare earth 
manganites which actually has a gene inside 
the lattice the magnetism controls the electrical 
conductivity and as a result there is a 
huge drop in resistance when you try to disturb 
the magnetic ordering there And in the 
next example we saw it need not be a ferromagnetic 
material in bulk but if you can 
make stack layers of ferromagnet and antiferromagnet 
or ferromagnet and a spacer layer 
then you would expect a colossal change in 
the resistance 
So we looked at the few examples of this 
metallic multi layers we are actually looking 
into the theme of the various aspects of 
magnetoresistance we call it G M R we call 
it T 
M R C M R G M R and T M R are predominantly 
involving metallic ferromagnetic 
layers whereas C M R is confined more to 
oxides So we looked at the example of C 
M 
R we looked at example of multilayers of 
G M R and we looked little bit into the 
mechanism of T M R which brings about a colossal 
change in resistance 
Just to give you a recap of what is the central 
issue the issue is to make use of the 
electron spin electron has a down spin and 
electron has a up spin ; therefore you can 
try 
to exploit the orientation of this electron 
spin up or spin down and you can try to 
moderate the electrical conductivity 
In the bulk there are ferromagnetic materials 
as you know paramagnetic material is best 
exemplified in this fashion when magnetic 
field is removed the moments are oriented 
in 
random way whereas if when they are aligned 
when applied magnetic field is stronger 
and it can reorient all this in direction 
So this is the situation of a paramagnet 
and then 
we also looked at a typical ferromagnet typical 
ferromagnet gets ordered below T E C 
they are ordered like this and above T C 
they get reoriented into a paramagnetic phase 
Now the point is the presence of magnetic 
field produces only anisotropic 
magnetoresistance and the order of such change 
in resistance is very very small as a 
result you can not bring about a colossal 
change in resistance when you are looking 
at 
anisotropic magnetoresistance Therefore 
you need to use the same ferromagnetic 
material but you should align it in different 
way you should stack it in different way 
then you can induce a colossal drop in magnetoresistance 
So far we have seen the many phases of magnetoresistance 
we call this as G M R we 
call this as T M R and we call this as C M 
R A G M R predominantly we are talking 
about metallic multilayers and organic inorganic 
multilayers in T M R we looked at 
metal insulator metal trilayers and C M R 
predominantly rare earth manganites and 
ruthenates Today I am going to spend little 
bit more time on this issue of organic 
inorganic multilayers and why it is advantageous 
why we need to go for such a 
combination of organic inorganic multilayers 
Now just to bring back to focus the important 
mechanisms that governs we said if 
there is a ferromagnet here which is aligned 
in this direction ferromagnet here which 
is 
aligned in this direction And it is separated 
by a non magnet of this dimension then you 
have different resistance pathway one is 
if the up spin electron is going from here 
to 
here then you have a resistance pathway in 
this form and if you have a down spin then 
you have a resistance pathway in this form 
So if you are if it is an antiparallel direction 
your ferromagnets are antiparallely 
aligned then you have a different pathway 
for resistance and this is the model that 
we 
proposed So overall if you have a antiparallel 
situation then you have larger resistance 
and if you apply a magnetic field you have 
a smaller resistance specially via this form 
which we call it as short circuit therefore 
you can see a change in the magnetoresistance 
this is mostly a spin dependent scattering 
which happens across the interface 
The other one we also told about the mechanism 
of a tunneling magnetoresistance in 
the aligned case you actually have the spin 
up electrons going from here to here when 
they are aligned parallel And in that case 
the spin sub bands both are same whereas 
when it is aligned in antiferromagnetic fashion 
the spin up band is located here whereas 
in this case spin up band is located here 
Therefore there is a reluctance for this 
electron 
to go here and therefore this resistance 
is going to be greater in the antiparallel 
way So 
these are important considerations for 
the resistance across multilayers 
Another example that we can think of is instead 
of a insulator a nonmagnetic insulator 
you can try to replace that with a ferromagnetic 
insulator what would happen if there is 
a ferromagnetic insulator then electron when 
it goes from here to here If suppose it 
is 
up spin and then it has to retain it is spin 
memory when it goes to this layer and in 
that 
case if there is a ferromagnetic ordering 
or if there is a ferromagnetic alignment 
in this 
insulating phase Then the spin up can have 
the this electron can have a spin memory 
which can be retained as it goes to this layer 
So this is also a useful concept instead 
of using a nonmagnetic insulator you can 
go for 
a ferromagnetic insulator to maintain the 
spin memory as the electron goes from one 
electrode to the other electrode So in that 
case what is a situation this red M H loop 
M 
versus H loop what do you see here corresponds 
to nickel ferrite N F O is nothing but N 
i F e O which is a spinal spinal ferrite 
and this is ferromagnetic 
And this is a insulator typically it gives 
magnetic hysteresis loop of this fashion and 
you 
also have the hysteresis loop of the unsintered 
iron layer which is having a rather 
different coercivity compared to the bottom 
layer which is actually grown at a 
degree C So you have essentially same thickness 
of iron but with different coercivity 
because in one case you grew the film at 
therefore the coercivity changes and other 
case you have iron which is deposited at 
room temperature therefore it has a different 
coercivity 
So you have different coercive ferromagnetic 
electrodes and separated by a 
ferromagnetic insulator typically you would 
see the device showing the M versus H 
loop in this form So what is unique about 
this you have this staircase you have this 
staircase type of hysteresis loop which is 
typical for a device So if a device is 
performing then you have the staircase sort 
of feature and then the magnetoresistance 
also shows a pronounced activity you can 
see although the order of percentage M R is 
rather low 
But you can clearly see this butterfly shape 
butterfly wing shaped M R curve which 
clearly shows that this sort of magnetoresistive 
feature can be accomplished with a 
ferromagnetic insulator So this is another 
example one can think of you can make this 
device in this fashion you first put iron 
electrode and then this is your N F O layer 
and 
then you put another stripe of F e then you 
can measure the voltage that develops across 
this interface 
So this is one example where we can show 
that you can use variety of spacer layers 
not 
just nonmagnetic layer you can use M G O 
we have already seen one example of M G 
O which is neither magnetic nor it is metallic 
but it is a antiferromagnetic insulator and 
this is also showing a pronounced tunneling 
magnetoresistance 
Now G M R can also be seen in granular systems 
what is granular system for example 
if you take a cobalt silver these are not 
miscible in other words we can say they 
are 
immiscible they are immiscible alloys So 
if you actually deposit say silver layer and 
then you try to put cobalt layer it would 
not grow as a silver layer and then as a 
dimensional cobalt layer What would happen 
because of the immiscibility all the cobalt 
will actually form clusters they will form 
clusters of cobalt atoms and it will be 
deposited on the silver matrix 
Now the interaction between these clusters 
will determine what sort of 
magnetoresistance that you can get and this 
is also called as granular system one 
drawback about the granular system is the 
field sensitivity is less we can also achieve 
that using iron and silver Now you can 
make several such composites for example 
one can run through nickel ferrite P P Y 
this is a example of how this G M R can be 
seen even in bulk because your N F O is 
nothing but ferromagnetic insulator You can 
try to provide the conducting pathway by coating 
it intimately with the polypropylene 
so or polypyrrole So in this case you take 
pyrrole and you try to polymerize in situ 
with 
suspended nickel ferrite 
So as pyrrole is getting polymerized you 
will see that these nickel ferrite particles 
are 
coated intimately by pyrrole polypyrrole 
as a result you get a conducting matrix like 
this So the moments are actually aligned 
randomly and you have the polypyrrole 
matrix which is actually holding all these 
nickel ferrite clusters now this can give 
us 
some clue whether we can achieve magnetoresistance 
in this sort of bulk composites 
Because so far we have seen whether there 
is pronounced m r in metallic multilayers 
now we can also see whether there is any 
faint chance of harvesting a large percentage 
magnetoresistance in bulk composites 
If you actually take a look at the infrared 
spectra and the xray diffraction spectra 
you 
would find it is very interesting that the 
pure N F O that is nickel ferrite gives a 
typical 
spinal pattern whereas the P P Y which is 
a polymer gives you amorphous pattern 
Now if you keep loading nickel ferrite in 
P P Y to the order of percent percent 
or 
percent in spite of loading that much 
of nickel ferrite even with little percentage 
of P 
P Y you can see still the faint amorphous 
pattern dominates over the crystalline nickel 
ferrite What it suggests that nickel ferrite 
can be intimately coated by polypyrrole as 
a 
result you can try to measure the magnetoresistance 
in bulk in such composites 
The infrared spectra also gives you clue about 
the this particular band which is propping 
up with the increasing N F O because this 
is a characteristic nickel oxygen bond which 
can be seen in this N F O P P Y matrix So 
one can actually make quite a bit of 
composite materials with the wide range of 
loading capacity 
And one can see whether this also gives pronounced 
G M R if you actually take 
polypropylene itself which is a metallic 
polymer you would see that there is a positive 
magnetoresistance and it is of the order of 
less than percent although but it shows 
a 
more significant M R at K 
But what we find here for a optimum composition 
of percent N F O which is a N F 
O P P Y composite we see M R is much more 
higher than even the percent So there 
seems to be some influence of the N F O loading 
on polypyrrole and there seems to be 
some way that we can look for a magnetoresistance 
even in these bulk composites 
although the magnitude is less 
We can also look at the other granular system 
that is cobalt silver again in this case 
you 
have the iron or cobalt silvers which is 
dispersed in the silver matrix and we can 
achieve 
this sort of cobalt silver alloys by using 
sodium borohydride as the reducing agent 
And 
this is the overall reaction as to what happens 
sodium borohydride reacts with metal 
salts and it releases metal and boric acid 
and all this can be easily removed filtered 
therefore essentially you get a pure metal 
If you are going to take metals M N and 
M prime N plus then you can actually get 
a 
alloy and this alloy can be nano in size 
as I told you if it is a granular M R the 
feature is 
something similar to this Where you have 
the saturation value is rather high because 
the switching phenomena of this randomly oriented 
moments takes larger field as a 
result you have a very low saturation effect 
Nevertheless we can see for a percent 
cobalt doped silver alloy in other words 

alloy we can say you see a very nice trend 
of a metallic behavior down to Kelvin And 
we have tried to measure the magnetic property 
or the T C for this alloy and this is 
reported to be above Kelvin 
Because of the measuring constraints one can not 
measure magnetoresistance beyond 
so for this reason we have tried to 
measure the M R at and we see that near 
to 
T E C This sort of granular alloy show a 
pronounced effect of up to percent M R 
in 
this bulk cobalt silver composites this 
is new because there are no reports where 
cobalt 
silver alloy is known to show such high values 
It is possible from this work that one can 
try to prepare by either sputtering or other 
methods to prepare cobalt silver films and 
try 
to look at the T C close to sorry M R close 
to the T C 
We can also try to do this with the iron silver 
alloy composites where you see again a 
clear metallic behavior down to Kelvin and 
one can see that with increasing 
temperature the resistance increases and M 
R shows a very clear feature Although the 
M 
R percentage is significantly low but it 
is showing higher proportion at K compared 
to 
K 
So you have another composition iron silver 
alloy which also shows similar trend 
where you see lesser M R percentage at room 
temperature compared to Kelvin and 
this can be engineered for applications if 
we can translate this composites into thin 
films 
So I have shown you a variety of combinations 
of alloys which show M R behavior 
just to sum up at this stage what I have 
shown to you is that this stacking of multilayers 
is very important And one can try to engineer 
a variety of combinations as spacer layers 
and we can try to observe significant M R 
in cases of metallic multilayers and there 
is 
lot more work to be done for spacer layers 
which are not traditionally metallic 
So we will go to another important issue 
of organic multilayers we can start from 
the 
origin where exactly this idea stems from 
this is known as a dominant feature in organic 
light emitting diodes In organic light emitting 
diodes we have almost all the layers 
which are organic but for the anode and the 
cathode So why these organics can be 
brought into spintronics what is the need 
and what are the advantages over the metallic 
multilayers is the question 
Now spin based electronics as you know we 
can try to read the information of each of 
this domains if we can look at the spin orientation 
So depending on the spin 
orientation you can have a binary information 
storage that has nonvolatility it can 
have high integration density and fast switching 
time and low power consumption All 
these are advantageous for spin based electronics 
which are obviously absent or a incurs 
costly penalties when you think of the regular 
semiconducting industry So for this 
reason we need to a look at new possible 
avenues where we can try to look for wider 
applications involving organic spintronics 
Now why spins in organics there are perturbing 
factors of spin orientation in bulk 
number you have spin orbit interaction 
in this case interaction between electron 
spin 
and nuclear charge are becoming important 
And this is more pronounced for heavier 
atoms the spin orbit interaction is more 
pronounced for heavier atoms And then you 
also have another competing interaction which 
is hyperfine interaction this interaction 
is between the electron spin and the nuclear 
spin 
So you have issues that you confront in 
the multilayer systems specially when you 
think of spintronics one is electron spin 
interacting with nuclear charge another one 
electron spin competing with nuclear spin 
As a result you have the spintronic values 
or 
the magnetoresistance values are considerably 
low specially when you involve a heavier 
atoms because the spin orbit coupling contribution 
is of the order of Z to the power 
Z is the nuclear charge as a result since 
this is dependent on a Z power the 
contribution of spin orbit coupling is usually 
dominating and that is why we should try 
to see whether we can completely ignore this 
contribution so that you can maximize on 
the G M R or the magnetoresistance ratio 
There comes the issue of organic molecules 
if 
I need to subdue this both these effects 
then I should look for organic molecules 
which 
are lighter atoms And they are better alternatives 
because you can minimize both on 
spin orbit coupling and hyperfine interaction 
to a larger level as a result there is a 
search 
for new compounds 
Now where does organic come into picture 
in electronics the classic example is that 
of 
organic L E D because in the year it 
was van Slyke and tang who actually 
reported organic electro luminescent devices 
a which appeared in applied physics letters 
And a typical organic L E D configuration 
is like this you have the transparent I T 
O 
which is compounded which P dot P S S which 
is a whole doping layer and then you 
also have aluminum as cathode with a small 
barrier lithium fluoride 
Now if this is sandwiching a organic semiconductor 
then light comes out of the I T O 
layer which brings about a new generation 
of display devices These are all the oled 
devices which are presently coming into market 
you can bring down the screen size 
because you can go for large area and also 
you can minimize on the deposition 
intricacies So organic semiconductors brings 
about a new generation of devices which 
involves a spin 
Now spins in organics is construed in this 
way what is the mechanism of this organic 
L 
E D as you see here electrons come from 
the anode and then holes go from the cathode 
and they do combine here When they combine 
first they are held by a coulombically 
bound electron hole pair and this value 
specially refers to spin singlet and 
spin 
triplets both in electron hole pairs and 
they together combine as excitons So as 
electron 
hole pair the proportion is spin singlet 
and spin triplets 
Now they together combine to form a exciton 
with a singlet proportion and a triplet 
nature So you can actually have the singlet 
exciton and the triplet exciton of which 
the 
excitonic spin singlets are the ones which 
radiate the fluorescent light in other words 
if 
you look at the spin statistics you have 
percent or th of the possibility is 
the singlet 
exciton and th of the possibility is the 
triplet exciton And because of spin rule 
spin 
selection rule only the singlet excitons 
are allowed to radiate and therefore they 
account 
for the light that you see in a organic LED 
In other words of the of the excitons that 
are produced due to electron hole combination 
you have only percent which is responsible 
for the light emission and percent is 
spin forbidden There are ways to harvest 
this if you can annihilate this triplets 
then you 
can convert this into singular pair and thereby 
you can increase the efficiency of this 
singlet excitons which radiate florescent 
light 
So this is what I said the singlet which 
is responsible for the florescence and the 
triplets 
excitons which are responsible for the phosphorescence 
this is the theoretical limit and 
the experimental observations are slightly 
higher than percent in various cases Now 
these are some of the organic molecules which 
are used in the current oled devices and 
mostly these are all polymers P P V P F O 
M E H P P V and P H and so on 
Now how do how can we translate the spin 
L E D into a spin magnetoresistive device 
if you carefully look at this configuration 
this is your oled device And if you want 
to 
convert it into a spin valve all you need 
to do is replace this anode a cathode and 
anode 
by ferromagnetic electrodes So if you replace 
I T O with a ferromagnetic electrode if 
you replace aluminum with a ferromagnetic 
electrode then you are essentially making 
a 
spin valve device which involves a organic 
layer 
This ferromagnetic electrode can be a metal 
inorganic metal such as say iron or it can 
be 
cobalt so essentially you are making a iron 
organic iron electrode or device where you 
can look for this spin valve operation and 
this is typically the way we can cartoonize 
the 
spin valve structure that involves a organic 
where you have a ferromagnet and 
ferromagnet this is the organic layer 
And as you see that when they when the ferromagnets 
are aligned then there is more of 
electron mobility as a result you have a 
current high situation when the spin valve 
is 
open Now if they are antiparallely aligned 
then you have current low and therefore 
even with this sort of a configuration ferromagnet 
organic layer ferromagnet device you 
can essentially bring about a spin valve response 
using organic 
And this is the way that a spin valve will 
work if you have this sort of a configuration 
then you will see a sharp rise in the resistance 
as a result you can imitate this to be like 
a 
inorganic spin valve 
So in organic spin valve what are the examples 
park actually reported this first work 
where he used L S M O and cobalt as the ferromagnetic 
electrodes one of the reason 
why L S M O which is lanthanum strontium 
manganese oxide which is used is because 
this is known to be a percent spin polarized 
half metal and therefore we can use this 
as a bottom electrode and the interface also 
can by and large can be moderated if you 
are 
going to put a organic layer 
P H T is nothing but a thiophene moiety 
with substitutions and this is a good hole 
transport layer as a result we can try to 
have this in between ferromagnetic electrodes 
and the cobalt can be used as a top electrode 
which is reported by majumdar and 
coworkers and they have reported this in 
So this is a typical configuration of a 
organic spin valve where you are essentially 
using ferromagnetic electrodes and your 
middle layer is your organic but what are 
the problems here 
Problems in making this is to do with the 
interface because to grow a organic and a 
inorganic interface it is very very difficult 
because this organic layer should be good 
enough to wet the inorganic layer or the inorganic 
layer has to be atomically flat So that 
you can make a very thin dimensional layer 
of your organic which is the challenge 
otherwise many such structures could have 
been realized by now So far the limitation 
is 
you can not grow a good interface here because 
of the roughness that is coming from the 
inorganic layer and because of the growth 
mode which can vary for the organic layer 
Never the less you for the device that we 
saw which involves cobalt P H T L S M O 
layer you can see here the magnetoresistance 
at K and magnetoresistance at K it 
is sufficiently remarkable response is there 
In this case you can see at K a very large 
response and in the other case you see a 
faint response of above percent at 
K 
which is not a bad number considering the 
metallic multilayers at room temperature 
definitely there is a good response for this 
device A spin injection and spin transport 
and spin detection seemingly are proved in 
this organic electronic device these are 
small but distinct signature at room temperature 
therefore spin polarized transport 
through organic multi materials is therefore 
possible 
So what is this organic magnetoresistance 
which can be called as OMAR organic 
multilayers first even before a typical organic 
spin valve was done a typical oled device 
was taken and magnet was kept in closer proximity 
And this is the response that you 
would see a huge change in the resistance 
with the driving voltage is realized when 
you 
have P F O as the organic layer And therefore 
a typical oled device can also give you a 
large magnetoresistance it need not necessarily 
involve a ferromagnet organic 
ferromagnet trilayers even a typical organic 
L E D can give you large room temperature 
response 
Because of the spin statistics that are involved 
in such phenomena using this as a clue 
towards printed magnetic sensors based on 
organic diodes Majumdar group have come 
out with another structure which involves 
silver aluminum and P H T and put it 
between the magnets and then you can see a 
clear M R behavior that can be seen This 
gives us the challenge to go for printed electronics 
which is another good development 
in this field using organic layers 
So one can go for different models and how 
do we understand the organic 
magnetoresistance There are several issues 
that are being addressed one is the 
bipolaronic issue then the charge pair issues 
and also this spin interactions all this 
are 
discussed in different examples which are 
quoted in the recent past 
I would like to leave with the one more example 
on organic insulator we can take 
ferromagnetic layers and we can put a spacer 
And the spacer can be a nonmagnetic 
insulator which is a organic layer 
And what would happen in such situation we 
can try to make this sort of organic layers 
using pulsed electron deposition which is 
a rugged facility and this is a typical pulsed 
electron deposition chamber which has facility 
for a target carousal And you can use 
this pulsed electron beam to ablate the material 
from the target and typically during a 
ablation protocol you would see the plasma 
that is coming out 
Because you can essentially use this pulse 
beam for any type of material not only 
metallic but you can use organic material 
you can use insulating material to ablate 
this 
sort of compounds and this is the over all 
setup while in use So we can see some 
examples as to how we can look for magnetoresistance 
using organic layers in the next 
slide 
So this is a very good facility for making 
organic trilayers mainly because the insulating 
organic material can easily be ablated this 
is very different compared to pulsed laser 
deposition Pulsed laser deposition is a technique 
where laser plume laser light falls on 
the target something like this and then it 
ablates the material but if the material 
is 
insulating and it has a wide band gap then 
it is difficult for the laser light to be 
absorbed 
by the material and ablation will be remarkably 
low So for this reason you can replace 
that with a electron beam then you can try 
to ablate any material either metallic or 
insulating material 
So you can make any device applications and 
this is typically for the compound P T F E 
which is commercially known as Teflon Teflon 
is a good insulator and we can use 
Teflon as a organic layer between ferromagnetic 
electrodes and typically if you have 
the P T F E deposited using P E D You can 
see the thickness profile and this thickness 
profile is evaluated from a profilometer and 
you can actually go up to nanometers 
thick P T F E layer can be deposited And 
this is how you can look at your thickness 
profile one can also go down up to nanometer 
comfortably with a continuous 
deposition of this film in dimensional way 
So after ensuring that it is possible for 
us to make a device structure of this 
configuration iron P T F E iron trilayer 
how do you go about it first you put a iron 
stripe 
like this and then we can put the organic 
layer And then you can put one more metallic 
layer on the top and you can measure across 
the electrodes and then you can also see the 
A F M images of the iron layer which is deposited 
as a bottom electrode 
This is actually deposited at degree C 
and then you can put a nanometer thick P 
T 
F E film the surface looks like this And 
then the top layer which is actually deposited 
at room temperature shows a much larger grain 
size compared to smaller grain size for 
iron electrode 
Now how does the device respond if you individually 
take the top and the bottom 
electrodes iron electrodes you can see the 
coercivity is different because when you 
deposit the iron at degree C or so then 
the coercivity shrinks whereas the top layer 
shows higher coercivity which is deposited 
at room temperature And this is the typical 
signature for the device when device is there 
then you would see this step hysteresis 
loop which is showing the clear device operation 
Now you can vary the thickness we can go 
down to nanometer nanometer 
nanometer and nanometer and as you increase 
the P T F E thickness you can see that 
this step is more resolved compared to smaller 
one thicknesses Now the question is 
when you can achieve such small thickness 
of this P T F E layers whether the device 
can 
clearly show magnetoresistance is the question 
you would see that in the next slide 
When you have nanometer and nanometer 
although you have this step hysteresis 
loop which is characteristic of a device 
but when you look at the magnetoresistance 
they are essentially showing negative magnetoresistance 
negative M R which means 
the top iron layer is actually getting coupled 
with the bottom iron layer Only then you 
will see a negative magneto resistance but 
if they are clearly separated by P T F E layer 
then you should actually see positive magnetoresistance 
which is nothing but the 
response for tunneling magnetoresistance device 
So what does that mean even though you have 
a step magnetic hysteresis there is 
shorting between the bottom and the top iron 
electrodes it is short circuiting as a result 
We can say that this layer is not flat or 
it is not fully covered there are pin holes 
in this 
layer which is actually bringing about a 
short circuit between the top and the bottom 
electrode 
So what do you do if you go further to 
nanometer if you go to nanometer then 
you 
see this response is much clearer and if you 
look at the magnetoresistance compared to 
the previous one In previous one it is a 
inverted response whereas when you go to 
a 
higher thickness you see that the response 
is now positive So what does that mean 
at 
critical thickness of say nanometer you 
are able to clearly demonstrate a tunneling 
magneto resistance behavior as a result you 
see a positive M R although the value is 
very less still it is appreciable to show 
that organic spintronic can be demonstrated 
Now what is the clue for whether this device 
is working if you look at the resistance 
value for such a device you can see in the 
presence and absence of field the resistance 
is varying and the value of resistance gives 
you a clue as to whether such a device is 
working Suppose the top electrode and the 
bottom electrode are short circuiting then 
the value of this resistance will be less 
than ohms or this may be in milliohms 
Because it 
is essentially coming from iron electrode 
the fact that you are seeing a very 
high resistance it means the organic layer 
is able to decouple the bottom electrode from 
the top electrode as a result you see a pronounced 
T M R value So this 
is another 
example that we can 
look more positively into making organic spin 
valve or organic T 
M R junctions which can give you pronounced 
G M R behavior there are lot more 
things one has to do specially in understanding 
how the inorganic organic surfaces 
work 
Just to conclude what we have seen so far 
spin and spintronics will pave way for future 
electronics number and organics in spintronics 
is a fundamentally logical and plausible 
goal provided you have a ways and means to 
deposit these organic films in a very 
sequential way And spin polarized transport 
in organic is now proved even at room 
temperature if you can carefully look for 
a suitable combinations then you can achieve 
maximum spin polarized transport via organic 
layers 
And we can also say organic magnetoresistance 
phenomenon opens possibilities for a 
new application of this existing technology 
So we have actually in essence seen 
different phases of M R phases of M R 
we saw about a G M R which is 
in stacked 
multilayers and then we saw some examples 
of tunneling magnetoresistance in trilayers 
We 
have seen some example 
of granular M R 
in bulk composites and we have also seen 
organic G M 
R where we are bringing the hyperfine interactions 
and the spin orbit 
coupling interactions into focus and we 
have tried to 
see whether organic spintronics can 
become a vital tool to address to the issue 
of magnetic storage So with this I will 
stop 
and we 
will continue with other examples of electrical 
conductivity in inorganic 
materials in 
the next lecture 

' ] [ u'We have come to the second lecture of module 
In the first lecture I discussed with 
you along the same lines of how a material 
can drop in resistance specially in a rare 
earth oxide such as lanthanum manganite How 
this particular unit cell displace a unique 
property of both becoming ferromagnetic as 
well as becoming metallic from a non 
magnetic and insulating state I call this 
as a genie inside the lattice because two 
things 
are operative in a same single lattice Now 
today I want to talk along the same lines 
of 
loosing resistance in a different class of 
compounds called metallic multi layers 
And the way the material looses the electrical 
resistivity brings a unique nature of giant 
magnetoresistance which can be used for a 
variety of applications To draw your 
attention more this metallic multi layers 
are presently used in our computer read heads 
and it has brought about a tremendous revolution 
in the magnetic storage system So 
quickly let me go through and tell you about 
the last lectures brief 
Here we told that the CMR oxide or Colossal 
Magneto Resistive manganese shows loss 
in resistance at the curie temperature if 
you apply a very high field and this can be 
used 
for magnetoresistivity or giant magnetoresistivity 
or colossal magnetoresistivity It is 
mentioned in different ways and by enlarge 
colossal MR is referred to manganites 
whereas giant magnetoresistivity is actually 
referred to multi layers Now this is the 
application that I drew your attention to 
that it can be used as a read head and you 
can 
also write information using this sort of 
devices So the compounds which show similar 
property colossal MR property is compounds 
based on LaMnO when substituted with 
strontium barium or copper 
Now what is important as per as the metallic 
multilayers are concerned this is a typical 
multilayer that is made and it is presently 
used in our computer hard disk And if you 
want to see the animation of this you should 
visit this website this is displayed in i 
b m 
dot com website where they will show you 
how the resistance varies with information 
and how that can be used for reading magnetic 
information In this device you would 
see this is a bit that has to be read we 
have a free layer which is this one 
This is a free magnetic layer and then you 
have a spacer layer in between and you have 
a 
pined layer this is also a ferromagnetic 
layer but this is actually pined to the exchange 
layer or antiferromagnetic layer This is 
also shown in this viewgraph where you have 
the copper spacer and you have the GMR free 
film nickel iron which is called permalloy 
and this is there on the top and you also 
have cobalt which is actually pined to a 
antiferromagnetic exchange film 
So when you have a ferromagnet and a ferromagnet 
divided by a spacer and this 
ferromagnetic layer is actually pined by a 
antiferromagnet then this top layer alone 
is 
free to rotate I will come to the physics 
of it later but what happens is in such 
a device 
system the reading capacity of this head 
becomes much much faster than the 
magnetoresistive head that is used now 
So the implications are phenomenal same 
thing you can do you can pin with an 
antiferromagnetic layer a magnetic layer 
Therefore this moment will be fixed this 
magnetic moment is fixed and then you have 
a instead of copper in the previous case 
you can put a insulating layer If you can 
pin this magnetization in this direction then 
when you apply magnetic field the magnetic 
field can either rotate this in this direction 
or it can rotate in this direction 
So this is free to rotate depending on the 
field of magnetization and in such case when 
the moments of this ferromagnetic layer and 
this is aligned then the electron that is 
flowing across this layer will easily tunnel 
whereas in this case because these two 
ferromagnetic layers are in opposite direction 
then the tunneling of this electron becomes 
difficult As a result you have a high resistance 
case and a low resistance case we will 
come to this later this is called TMR devices 
Tunneling MagnetoResistance In the 
previous case we talked about giant magnetoresistance 
both have tremendous 
application 
And this TMR device is actually used for magnetic 
random access memory devices 
which is a major break trough in today\u2019s 
technology Because an enlargement of the 
active layers in MRAM device is actually shown 
here and this is exactly the way a 
MRAM device look like where you have a antiferromagnet 
and this is actually pinning 
This is pinning a ferromagnetic layer whose 
electrons have the pin in this direction and 
then you have a coupling layer like this and 
then you have the other ferromagnetic layer 
here 
So you have the ferromagnetic layer and the 
antiferromagnetic layer which is actually 
pinning then you have a tunneling insulator 
and then another ferromagnetic layer on the 
top So this is the way a MRAM device is 
actually used in IBM the red and green spears 
represents electron spinning in opposite directions 
in the magnetic layers The very thin 
insulator allows electrons to quantum mechanically 
tunnel across this interface and 
information is actually stored in the top 
layer by forcing it is electron to spin in 
one 
direction or other 
So this is the free layer where the flip 
can either be clockwise or anticlockwise 
depending upon the configuration and depending 
upon the magnetic field direction So 
this is one of the major development in the 
magnetic storage where thin layers of 
ferromagnetic metals are actually stacked 
across a nonmagnetic layer or a insulating 
layer I will come to the details of it later 
Now according to Moore\u2019s law number of 
transistors increases per integrated circuit 
as 
a function of the number of years So if 
you see the transistors that can be 
accommodated in the integrated circuit has 
almost linearly increased and this is called 
Moore\u2019s law So you can actually have hundreds 
and thousands of transistors stacked in 
a integrated circuit now and this is bound 
to keep going in the future years The same 
analogy can be extrapolated for magnetic recording 
which is also equivalent to Moore\u2019s 
law 
The aerial density actually is keep increasing 
with the years it is almost you see a linear 
dependency Therefore magnetic recording 
more and more information can be stored in 
the hard disk because you have a powerful 
read head memory device now and the 
current memory device that is used by IBM 
is called spin valve MR head If you have 
opportunity you can visit the IBM website 
to understand how these multilayers are used 
to improve the aerial density So this is 
bound to bring lot of revolution into the 
magnetic recording market 
Now what is fundamental to this application 
is in the case of electronics so far people 
have worried more about the charge Charge 
and number of charge are very important 
for a semiconducting industry whereas if 
you look at another missing link in this whole 
application is the spin part of the electron 
Electron has spin either plus half or minus 
half and this spin actually can control the 
charge of the electron So far the spin part 
is 
actually forgotten electronic industry has 
exploited the issue of charge number of 
charge carriers 
But never it has bothered about controlling 
the charges or the mobility of electrons with 
respect to spin part Therefore if you apply 
a magnetic field then either it will be up 
spin 
or down spin and depending upon the population 
of electrons that you are going to force 
then you can modify the electronic part So 
that is what is called as spin electronics 
or 
spintronics it is also called as magneto 
electronics because you are trying to control 
the 
electronic property using magnetic field 
And this was actually proposed the issue 
of 
spin part was proposed as early as 
Now if you take any metal in the periodic 
table you can easily classify whether it 
is a 
non magnetic metal or whether it is a magnetic 
metal or it is a ferromagnetic metal Now 
in the case of copper chromium ruthenium 
we know that it is a metal but not a 
ferromagnetic metal why because you have 
the number of up spin electrons and the 
down spin electrons they are exactly having 
the same sub bands spin bands across the 
Fermi level 
So because they are equal then this can be 
actually called a nonmagnetic metal because 
the number of up spin electron cancels the 
number of down spin electrons therefore 
there is no net ferromagnetic moment there 
is no net magnetic moment Whereas in the 
case of iron cobalt and nickel as we saw 
in the first module the whole thing can be 
explained based on molecular orbital theory 
where you can see the spin up band has the 
spin band like this across the Fermi level 
and the spin down band has across the Fermi 
level band which is lower than the spin up 
band 
As a result there is a net moment which 
makes this material ferromagnetic now if 
you 
look at these compounds chromium dioxide 
which is actually used in video tape and this 
is the colossal magnetoresistive CMR oxides 
One of the interesting feature is one of 
the 
spin up band here is actually well above the 
Fermi level and what matters finally is the 
spin down band which is cutting across the 
Fermi level Therefore the conduction can 
actually come from one of the spin bands 
which is completely devoid of the Fermi level 
In such case this is called as half metallic 
ferromagnets this sort of magnets have 
percent polarization compared to the traditional 
ferromagnets 
These ferromagnets have percent polarization 
because in one of the configuration 
the spin up band is actually percent spin 
polarizing So this can be used for the 
GMR or CMR applications so this is very important 
as we think about what sort of 
material you want to use for tunneling magneto 
resistance Because if you want to 
tunnel the electron then if it is actually 
percent spin polarized then it can easily 
tunnel because there would not be any scattering 
process across the interface 
Now I will have to register this issue that 
the whole idea of CMR or GMR or TMR all 
this came to prominence because of the discovery 
of magnetoresistance by these two 
gentlemen this is Albert Fert from France 
and this is Peter Grunberg from Forschung 
center Mulisch Both of them found out that 
there is a strange coupling mechanism 
happening if you can maintain these metallic 
multilayers in a very very thin dimension 
And they found there is a huge response when 
you measure such stackings when you 
measure the electrical conductivity And they 
found there is a huge loss in resistance 
in 
the presence and absence of field and that 
is what brings to effect the GMR spin valves 
now what really they did 
This is Peter Grunberg who is receiving his 
Nobel prize in which marks the birth 
of spintronics Also I should say because 
they emphasized on thin magnetic or 
nonmagnetic layers as small as nanometer 
the issue of nano technology became more 
prominent after the discovery Now what did 
Peter Grunberg report in his report he 
said if you take only iron of this dimension 
say nanometer and if you measure the 
resistance as a function of magnetic field 
in both directions you see a very small change 
in the resistance which is called anisotrophic 
magnetoresistance which is of very low 
order 
Whereas if you now separate the same amount 
thickness of iron but you divide it as 
nanometer nanometer of iron and you put 
one single small layer of chromium which 
is only nanometer in this form then you 
can clearly see this same feature which is 
supposed to be there is now a more pronounced 
feature like this So what happens 
when there is zero field here when there 
is zero field these two ferromagnets are 
actually anti parallelly they are coupled 
they are antiferromagnetically coupled 
But they are not actually antiferromagnets 
the way they are coupled is of the opposite 
form therefore we call this as a antiferromagnetic 
coupling Now as you sweep the 
magnetic field in both directions you see 
that these two moments get ferromagnetically 
ordered in this fashion and at that point 
the resistance is really low And the same 
way it 
happens if you flip it to the other direction 
therefore there is a tremendous fall in 
resistance as you sweep the magnetic field 
Suppose you can keep reverting this at a 
very low field then it becomes a real magnetic 
switch So Albert Fert actually brought out 
this notion he said I can try to make several 
of these bilayers several of these bilayers 
instead of just a trilayer and everywhere 
I 
will try to change the spacer layer thickness 
so that is what he did If you have 
chromium as nanometer or nanometer 
or nanometer as you bring down the 
spacer layer smaller and smaller you can 
see there is a tremendous fall in resistance 
and 
also the field sensitivity is quite bright 
compared to even this example 
So if you make such bilayers repeats of 
angstrom iron and angstrom chromium and 
if you makes repeats like times or times 
like this then you see a tremendous fall in 
resistance And that makes the application 
much more prospective where you can now 
look for switch So that you can write 
and read the magnetic information as a 
bit 
so this is the birth for spin electronic applications 
Now what really happens is this carton tells 
you that if you have this ferromagnetic 
layer aligned in this direction and this ferromagnetic 
layer aligned in opposite direction 
they are antiferromagnetically coupled whereas 
in this case they are ferromagnetically 
coupled Now in both case you will see 
when they are antiferromagnetically coupled 
then they have a different resistance that 
is what we show here But once you force 
with 
the magnetic field in this direction all 
these antiferromagnetically coupled layers 
they 
also go ferromagnetic 
So as a result you have a low resistance 
state and a high resistance state at H is 
equal to 
which is important for magnetoresistive 
property But what is needed is this 
saturation can not take so much time it has 
to saturate very sharply for applications 
then 
only you can use such materials for bit 
reading or writing Otherwise if you takes 
too 
much of a field saturation then that can not 
really act as a very good device 
So to transform this people have made several 
structures and they have made something 
called spin valve where the top ferromagnetic 
layer is more like a valve and the bottom 
ferromagnetic layer is actually pinned to 
a antiferromagnetic So even with small 
magnetic field like valve you can rotate 
the moment of the top magnetic layer so that 
is 
the technological challenge 
L et me run through some of the issues just 
to register that in your memory this new 
field of electronics which is not based on 
conduction of electrons or holes but relies 
on 
the different transport properties of majority 
and minority spin electrons actually forms 
the bases for spin electronics Add to electronics 
an additional degree of freedom that is 
the spin character so you are actually using 
the spin of the electron for governing the 
electronic properties 
So in magneto electronics you actually have 
passive elements which are resistors 
change in resistance happens upon application 
of magnetic field whereas in spintronics 
you actually have active elements which are 
spin transistors this amplify a current 
rather than merely switching it on or off 
So what are such characters you have a metal 
ferromagnet semiconductor non ferromagnet 
and then you also have a ferromagnet So 
this sort of structures can actually bring 
about the spintronic applications 
Another key factors that I want to emphasize 
is spin electronics in semiconductors are 
also possible and obstacle for spintronics 
is that electronics companies are geared 
up for 
semiconductors They are traditionally they 
know how to handle a semiconductor and to 
run the industry without any interruption 
And important goal is to make devices using 
semiconductors that are compatible with existing 
spin technology chip technology 
The problem is that conventional semiconductors 
use in integrated circuits are not 
magnetic this is why several research groups 
are exploring ways to tune the 
semiconductors into ferromagnetic metals 
which we call it as dilute magnetic 
semiconductors So another field apart from 
tunneling magnetoresistance comes into 
picture which is called DMS field where 
they want to retain the semiconductor 
technology 
But just do a careful manipulation so that 
you can make the semiconductor magnetic so 
that you can tune the electronic properties 
now controlling the spin part of the 
semiconductor The big problem here is spin 
polarized transport across the interfaces 
between 
different 
materials 
because 
interfaces 
are 
very 
sensitive 
between 
semiconductors and ferromagnetic metals presently 
they induce a Schottky barrier that 
is leading to loss of spin polarization 
So one has to overcome this Schottky barrier 
which is the challenge if you want to 
realize DNA situation here Ferromagnetic 
semiconductors injecting spin across the 
interface between two semiconductors one 
of them ferromagnetic should be easier 
because there is no Schottky barrier ZnSc 
doped with beryllium manganese or cobalt 
doped with TiO manganese doped with SnO 
they are all candidates for ferromagnetic 
semiconductors What is the aim you fully 
switchable all semiconductor spin valves are 
possible semiconductor spin transistors are 
possible So there are tremendous scope that 
is lying if we can generate newer materials 
A bit of history in the anisotropic magnetoresistance 
was reported as early as and in 
there was a discovery of transit action 
in germanium germanium transistors 
were discovered then and s this random 
access memories in computers were 
broughtin in USA Then first time a 
tunneling magnetoresistance response was 
reported by Julliere and IBM introduced 
thin films head which is called MR read 
heads which started coming and affecting 
the memory storage and that is where we saw 
the computers coming into every home 
And a bit of very recent history 
GMR was reported by both this Nobel 
laureates and IBM introduced the AMR 
effect for read out in hard disk drive And 
the spin valve effect was also recognized 
first commercial product using 
GMR a magnetic field sensor was brought in 
And a bit of history till our days tunnel 
magnetoresistance was rediscovered and in 
this is the most important stuff GMR 
using GMR property IBM brought it is first 
hard disk drive And in we have free 
scale semiconductor they currently sampling 
a megabit MRAM chip for back up memory in 
industrial and military environments In 
near future you have MRAM production expected 
in which is already set into 
action Now in we have a generation 
of MRAM devices which are coming into 
market This was actually a forecast several 
years back but this is actually turning out 
to 
be a reality in 
Now GMR in spin valves is typically of this 
nature I have already shown you a cartoon 
impressing upon the importance of it So 
you actually have a antiferromagnetic pining 
layer which is pinning a ferromagnetic layer 
therefore that moment is fixed And then 
you have a spacer layer and a free layer 
this free layer can rotate either this way 
or it can 
rotate this way freely changing the overall 
resistance of the device So typically if 
you 
want to look at the device the device will 
have a hysteresis M versus H hysteresis like 
this where in one direction you see the loop 
and the other direction is actually pinned 
If you measure the resistance as a function 
of field you can see when this ferromagnet 
is 
actually pinned it is coming this way and 
then this free layer can rotate very sharply 
In 
other words you can achieve saturation in 
even with or Oersted because this is 
a 
free layer and this can easily rotate to align 
in the direction in which it wants So you 
can get this field sensitivity in spin valve 
device which is of fundamental importance 
for 
technological applications 
And in this cartoon what we see here is GMR 
upto percent at just Oersted which 
is less than the field that is generated by 
the magnets which we try to put on the 
refrigerator So even with such a low magnetic 
field you can actually make this switch 
operate therefore it can be used for a magnetic 
sensor applications 
GMR can also be found in granular alloys 
granular alloys means those which are like 
cobalt copper If you co sputter or co deposit 
cobalt and copper you would see that 
cobalt and copper are not miscible So in 
a copper matrix cobalt will actually form 
a 
cluster like stuff instead of forming a continues 
layer cobalt will form clusters And 
depending on the cluster size of this cobalt 
in copper matrix you can see resistance 
varying and that is what you see here 
This is cobalt in copper and you can see as 
a function of temperature the magneto 
resistance changes And also one can change 
the GMR property based on the cluster size 
of cobalt metal so this is another way GMR 
property can be exemplified Now let me 
tell you briefly what really makes this useful 
for magnetic read head applications 
This is origin of the GMR and the principle 
that acts in this GMR is called spin 
dependent scattering spin is getting scattered 
at the interface between a ferromagnet and 
a metal and a metal and a ferromagnet So 
we can look at this situation in the following 
way there are two models given in these 
two models you see in this model this is 
a 
ferromagnet and this is a ferromagnet where 
the moments are aligned in same direction 
And in this it is a ferromagnet this is 
a ferromagnet and it is aligned in opposite 
fashion 
and this is the nonmagnetic layer which is 
a metal 
Now you have both situations of a spin up 
electrons spin down electron spin up electron 
when it is going from this layer to this layer 
as you are measuring the current you see 
because these two are up spin in this direction 
then there is no scattering it will just 
go 
cross this interface Whereas this spin down 
will get scattered little bit here and then 
it 
will go through again it will get scattered 
here So if you try to translate this to 
a 
resistivity model for the spin up there 
is low resistance path way which is like 
this 
But for a spin down the resistance path 
way actually comes out like this which is 
bigger because in both cases it is getting 
scattered therefore resistance in this form 
is a 
high resistivity issue So in one case you 
have a low resistance and in other case it 
is a 
higher resistance whereas when you come here 
for spin up it gets easily to this stage 
and then it gets scattered here Therefore 
you have a lower resistance and a higher 
resistance same thing happens for the spin 
down also here it gets more scattered and 
then it gets easily transmitted 
Therefore if you draw this resistivity model 
then you see in both cases there is higher 
resistance in either way Therefore in overall 
if you see this resistance is going to be 
very high compared to this this resistance 
when the ferromagnets are aligned 
antiparallel in this case ferromagnets are 
aligned parallelly So what happens is a 
short 
circuit therefore resistance is lower when 
these two are ferromagnetically aligned 
And when they are ferromagnetically non aligned 
they are antiferromagnetically aligned 
then you have a higher resistance and that 
is what is called GMR or Giant 
MagnetoResistance in the presence of field 
and in the absence of field you see 
difference So when magnetic informations 
are actually to be read you have a low 
resistance case or a high resistance case 
which can actually flip as a bit and 
this 
property is what is important for reading 
magnetic storage 
One thing that we need to understand if you 
want such GMR property to be there and if 
this is purely a spin dependent scattering 
then I will come to the previous one once 
more 
So if this has to go through without scattering 
this interface has to be very very sharp 
there should be no roughness If there are 
physical defects also scattering will occur 
therefore you need to know how to make thin 
layers like this 
So spin dependant scattering is one of the 
important issue and the next issue what we 
see 
here is as you increase the layer thickness 
of the spacer in this example it is gold 
which 
is used has a spacer layer And permalloy 
which is nothing but nickel iron I will write 
it 
here nickel iron is the permalloy and in 
this case you can see as you vary the thickness 
of your gold spacer layer the magnetoresistance 
varies like this like oscillation What 
does it mean at some thickness it is showing 
GMR property at some thickness it does 
not show GMR property 
So you can see several maxima is coming 
antiferromagnetic situation 
antiferromagnetic situation antiferromagnetic 
antiferromagnetic So if you keep 
on increasing the layer thickness of gold 
you should actually see more and more of 
GMR or lesser and lesser of GMR happening 
But what happens suddenly you see 
maximum GMR and then there is no GMR property 
and then there is GMR property and 
then it comes down so keeps on varying as 
a oscillatory fashion 
And that is because of the physics involved 
in it which can be interpreted based on 
RKKY type of coupling Therefore this is 
very important so you need to know what 
is 
the thickness of the nonmagnetic layer that 
you are depositing So this thickness of 
the 
nonmagnetic layer is oscillatory it can show 
maximum GMR at nanometer but at it 
may not show at all and at nanometer it 
might show again So that is purely because 
of the exchanged coupling which can be explained 
based on RKKY type of stuff 
I will come to this issue of origin of tunneling 
magnetoresistance in a few minutes from 
now So far I told you about the origin of 
giant magnetoresistance in metallic 
multilayers and the issue that I have emphasized 
there is that of spin dependence 
scattering Therefore when you make such 
very thin films the interface has to be 
extremely flat otherwise the electrons can 
get scattered not just by the moment but 
by 
the interfacial roughness 
Therefore maintaining such flat layers is 
very important for which people use molecular 
beam epitaxy as a very convenient tool to 
make such flat terraces And if you are 
wanting to know whether your material is 
flat enough then you use scanning tunneling 
microscopy to study whether it is atomically 
flat The other origin of TMR device 
which we call it as tunneling magnetoresistance 
this is not only based on interfacial 
scattering but it is based on spin dependent 
tunneling where the spin sub bands of the 
ferromagnetic layers and this ferromagnetic 
layer is very important 
The spin sub band of this ferromagnet and 
the spin sub band of this ferromagnet is 
important so let me take it out So this 
spin sub band represents that of the 
ferromagnetic layer here and this spin sub 
band determines that of this one So when 
two 
ferromagnetic layers are aligned then the 
spin sub bands are also same so what would 
happen the up spin electrons can easily hop 
to this one and same is true for the down 
spin electrons they will happily go across 
the insulating layer 
In this case this is a small barrier it 
will tunnel through the small barrier to the 
other 
ferromagnetic layer and this is the situation 
when you apply a magnetic field Suppose 
you do not apply a magnetic filed H is equal 
to then you would see that this up spin 
electron is going reluctantly to this spin 
sub band because they are antiferromagnetically 
coupled As a result the position of this 
up spin band here is different from the position 
of the up spin band here 
So energetically they are not favorable 
therefore it is going reluctantly same is 
true for 
the down spin band In this case it is positioned 
here whereas in this case it is 
positioned here therefore energetically it 
is not favorable in both cases you see a 
reluctance in the transfer of the spins up 
or down spin As a result in the antiparallel 
configuration resistance is greater than 
the resistance in the parallel configuration 
and 
this is not based on the spin interfacial 
scattering this is based on spin dependent 
tunneling 
And one more thing that is important to note 
in TMR devices this should not be a metal 
this should be a insulator and this insulator 
should be thin enough so that this quantum 
mechanical tunneling can be effective So 
this is called as Tunneling MagnetoResistance 
TMR and this property what is happening here 
is a spin dependent tunneling 
If we have different spin bands then the first 
question that I would like to know is what 
is this spin polarization of this ferromagnets 
what I am using And the definition for this 
spin polarization is spin density of the 
up spin states minus density of the down spin 
electrons divided by the density of the up 
spin plus density of the down spin where 
D 
plus and D minus represents a density of states 
near the Fermi level Now to measure 
this spin polarization there are two methods 
one is tunneling technique and the other 
one is Andreev reflection method 
In both cases we can try to measure the spin 
polarization of the ferromagnets what you 
are using and for example this is permalloy 
nickel iron permalloy In case of tunneling 
experiment you see spin polarization upto 
say percent whereas in the Andreev mode 
you see it is around same is true for 
cobalt and you can measure for nickel iron 
And 
you can measure for nickel manganese antimony 
this is called a Heusler alloy Heusler 
alloy or lanthanum strontium manganites that 
also shows upto percent of spin 
polarization 
But the best one to show is CrO which 
is a ferromagnetic metal which seems to show 
spin polarization upto percent or so because 
it is a half metallic ferromagnet So these 
are good candidates for using this as a electrode 
for tunneling magnetoresistance devices 
So one of the important criteria is that 
one of the spins should be a majority spin 
and if 
it is percent spin polarized then tunneling 
magnetoresistance can be more 
pronounced for such applications There are 
other several other models or several others 
trilayers which have been tried 
There are experiments on tunneling for a very 
long time as early as Julliere he 
found that in iron germanium cobalt you can 
get upto percent at K But this is 
interesting because he was the first one 
to report the tunneling magnetoresistance 
nevertheless the numbers are not very attractive 
because you have to get this sort of 
huge values at room temperature Now there 
was another report where they have used 
nickel nickel oxide is a antiferromagnetic 
compound which is a insulator and nickel 
cobalt layers show magneto resistance like 
this 
And TMR is actually tunneling magnetoresistance 
which is explained in terms of spin 
polarization as P P by minus P P 
that is the order of TMR and this P P 
is 
the polarization of the first electrode and 
the second electrode So the TMR values 
entirely dependents on the spin polarization 
more than the thickness of the metallic 
layers Because that thickness becomes more 
prominent for giant magnetoresistive 
devices for a TMR devices it is the polarization 
which is more important 
You can also get very nice TMR response if 
you actually have a permalloy alumina 
cobalt junction where alumina is used as 
a tunneling barrier because alumina is a 
very 
good insulator so it is possible to get TMR 
devices like that And this is again another 
example where you can clearly see that there 
is a very nice saturation for a spin valve 
junction operating on a TMR property So 
you can actually get this sort of a response 
if 
you can try a variety of trilayer or a bilayer 
devices In a typical TMR device you can 
see how many magnetic signatures happen if 
you record the magnetic hysteresis 
If it is a typical TMR device then you are 
supposed to see this sort of a staircase like 
magnetic hysteresis and that staircase like 
magnetic hysteresis has something to say 
The 
device that is shown here is that of gallium 
arsenide based device where this is the 
substrate and 
this is a MgO layer that is deposited also 
to provide the substrate template 
And then you have the ferromagnetic layer 
ion in angstrom that is nanometers 
and then separated by a nanometer MgO and 
then you have angstrom FeCo 
In such a situation you can see if this 
layer and this layer are ferromagnetically 
coupled 
you see the saturation reaching very fast 
And as you come down at this dip staircase 
you can see that the lower one is antiferromagnetically 
coupled and then you can come 
down further the top layer gets rotated 
therefore you see again a fully ferromagnetic 
layer at say Oersted So at Oersted 
here and Oersted here in both case it 
is 
ferromagnetically coupled but in the staircase 
area you can see that they are 
antiferromagnetically coupled and this is 
a true property of a trilayer TMR device 
So in any TMR device you should see a staircase 
like property which is a signature that 
you have made the device And the same is 
true actually if you measuring it along this 
access and if you measure it along this axis 
you see here a double staircase phenomena 
will come That is because this moment is 
actually rotating this spin is actually rotating 
therefore you see a double staircase situation 
if you are going to measure it along 
plane 
Now this TMR device can also be extended 
to other cases one of the problem that we 
face is when electron goes or tunnels from 
one ferromagnetic layer to another 
ferromagnetic layer the electron is scattered 
because of short or long time scales then 
the 
spin that the electron carries from here to 
here will be lost or will be minimized The 
effect will be minimized because of the nonmagnetic 
layer why because if you are 
using a nonmagnetic metal or if you are using 
a heavier metal ion then there will be spin 
orbit coupling that is contributing 
As a result there will be a spin orbit coupling 
happening as it goes from here to here so 
it is better for us to replace this metal 
with the organic layer because you have this 
spin 
relaxation times are of a very larger scale 
because there is no metal in organic 
compounds So the electron can take it is 
own time to carry its spin memory from here 
to here without any scattering Therefore 
the recent TMR devices they are trying to 
replace the spacer layer from a insulating 
inorganic layer to a organic insulting layer 
In such case you can actually extent the 
spin memory of the electron going from this 
ferromagnet to this ferromagnetic layer by 
extending the length scale So lot of work 
is 
going on to understand that I will 
come to this issue later in one of the slides 
So you 
can make several such organic molecules to 
measure the GMR I will come to this issue 
shortly from now So you also can make other 
structure like europium sulphide which is 
a nonmagnetic chalcogenide people have explored 
and it shows TMR device like this 
Now what is the importance of TMR as I told 
you earlier the technological relevance of 
tunneling magnetoresistance is to produce 
magnetic random access memory Their fast 
dense nonvolatile cheaper and this is projected 
to become a billion dollar industry by 
We are almost realizing such a market 
trend as far as TMR property is concerned 
nearly every major technological company now 
has a hand in MRAM not only that 
there are good ferroelectric devices which 
are coming which are also useful for 
integration in MRAM 
So along with the ferromagnetic research 
there is also ferroelectric compounds which 
are essential for MRAM which makes this very 
very challengiing venture for most of 
the industries Each magnetic tunnel junction 
is a memory cell that stores a single bit 
of 
data So to write in such a cell one need 
only to apply a magnetic field to flip the 
spin 
orientation of one of this layers 
For the tunneling magnetoresistance involving 
organic compounds we call this as 
organic spintronics because several of these 
compounds can be used This is a 
sixethiophene which is used here and you 
also have thiophene molecules substituted 
with this sort of substituents which makes 
it more interesting Or you can also use the 
well know Alq it can also act as very good 
organic insulator in this TMR devices 
where organic spintronics can be demonstrated 
As I told you I am showing a enlarge view 
of the table which I referred earlier I 
can 
actually take two ferromagnets and now put 
T which is sexithienyl or you can take 
two ferromagnetic electrodes and you can put 
a organic molecule like Alq or PHT 
you can put PHT is here that is poly 
hexylthiophene PHT or you can use POT or 
you can also use phenyl porphyrin phenyl 
porphyrin can be used here where 
ferromagnet and another ferromagnet is there 
MR ratio of the order of percent can be 
achieved using porphyrin and MR ratio upto 
percent can be achieved using POT but 
at lower temperature What is important is 
these three device configurations where you 
can achieve TMR property to a greater 
extent at room temperature that 
is important Because for fundamental applications 
you 
need TMR properties at room temperature where 
you can clearly see organic molecules 
are coming into picture 
PHT is used thiophene is used so it is 
very challenging issue as of now to make 
lot of 
device combinations for TMR junctions I will 
try to discuss how other organic layers 
can 
be 
used in this sort of device applications 
May be in the next lecture and see how 
the magnetoresistive devices can 
be improved with various combination of these 
interlayers I will stop here 
What we have seen in this lecture is that 
making magnetic multilayers of different sort 
with spacer layers brings about 
a enormous change in the resistance in 
the presence and 
absence of magnetic field And this 
can be extrapolated to many devices having 
spaces 
as oxides spaces as nonmagnetic metals spaces 
involving organic molecules and 
different magnetoresistive property can be 
observed and 
this is of importance for 
application so 
I stop here
