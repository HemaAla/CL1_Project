Welcome to the lectures on acoustic instabilities in aerospace propulsion My name is Sujith 
and I will be delivering this class So before 
I start off with the lecture I like to give 
a course outline 
So the course is dealing with how there are 
instabilities that happen in propulsion system 
or combustion system in the industry And 
this is something which we usually do not 
deal with in a propulsion course So usually in a propulsion course we talk about designing 
a propulsion system or a combustion system and those are basically based on study state 
principles rather than any instability analysis but here So you end up designing a engine 
or a system and then some times it goes unstable that is the engine develops very large levels 
of vibration and sound inside and create problems and may lead to destruction of engine or mission 
failure and so on And such scenario happen in real life and this course is to look at 
such phenomena So the course starts with an introduction 
to acoustics and how combustion driven oscillations 
occurred And we will then do the derivation 
of the wave equation we will then speak about 
solution derivation equation First we will 
be talking about what travelling wave solution 
and then standing wave solutions then we 
look at effect of inhomogeneous media on sound 
propagation That is in real engines temperature 
in the engine is not uniform its different 
from usual sound propagations that atmosphere 
or something where here the temperature be 
nonuniform So we will look at the effect 
of nonuniformity or homogeneity media on 
sound propagation then we look at multi 
dimensional acoustics So how does sound 
propagate in a can type combustor or how are 
the radial mode how are the tangential mode 
happening and so on 
And so this much is the basic acoustic part 
then we move on to looking at combustion stability 
First I will look at the fundamentals of combustion 
instability how it occurs and then we look 
at the basic principles we derive the equations 
that represent the describe combustion and 
stability We will speak about Rayleigh criteria 
which is the classical criteria that explains 
weather instabilities occur or not then look 
at instability in solid and liquid rockets 
ramjets and gas turbines engines 
We speak a little bit about pulse combustors 
and their use speak then about the passive 
and active control of combustion instability 
We will then see how we can do theoretical 
analysis of combustion instability and then 
we do model analyses which is the conventional 
technique for studying analyzing combustion 
instability And lastly we will look at the 
recent developments on nonmodel stability 
and analysis So basically you can see the 
courses split into two parts in the first 
part we are basically speaking about classical 
acoustics 
So we describe how waves are travelling in 
a medium how they get reflected how they 
get transmitted and so on So that is what 
is basically classical acoustics and the second 
part we will specially discuss\u2026 
Thermo acoustic instabilities and their analysis 
So this is what the course is and in today 
the first lecture we will speak about what 
causes the instabilities and how we will 
I will just give you a very preliminary introduction 
about what causes instability And how who 
there is established in combustors and how 
they can be suppressed 
So this is the first lecture that is a origin 
and suppression about of a combustion driven 
oscillations So as I mentioned propulsion 
is usually taught as a study state phenomena 
but in reality all the property system are 
designed based on study step principles they 
are not actually that study because when the 
stability comes there will be loud level of 
vibrations and noise And the fluid mechanics 
will be unsteady and you would end up having 
serious problems 
So first question is what is thermoacoustic 
instability ? This word thermoacoustic instabilities 
also refer to an by some other people as what 
is called combustion instability or thermoacoustics 
or combustion dynamics We will look at how 
common it is in fact it is quite common although 
people do not speak much about it it is there 
in most of the engines and some of the literature 
says that fifty percentage of the solid motor 
that are develop have combustion instability 
problems Let us speak about who we can eliminate 
it 
So I will giving an introduction to this subject 
in this lecture so whenever you decide rocket 
runs in a industrial burner whatever you 
decide it and then you go into tested and 
then bang you are struck with this instability 
problems And then this is the completely 
new ball game and we do not know how to deal 
with it this is there it was there you must 
if you look at the history of the moon program 
Americas moon raise to the moon they used 
F engine in the certain rocket which had 
serious instability problem and America had to work hard to get over it Like that so 
many rocket have this problem so many rockets have this problem So many industrial burners 
have this problem and usually this problem 
is identified only at the later stages of 
a program and then it\u2019s very hard to fix 
it So in this lecture we look at the origin 
of combustion driven oscillation and their 
suppression 
In the first part we look at what is combustion instability then we look at mechanisms that 
cause combustion instabilities how exactly 
these instabilities occur in various forms 
of various propulsive systems And then we look very briefly on active and passive control 
of instabilities So this is like a over view 
lecture and then we will deal with each of 
the topics in very serious manner in very 
liberate manner 
So India is now expanding its power capability 
we are I think we are doubling our generation 
capabilities in every or years So we 
are now starting to use gas turban engines 
to produce power these this was commonly 
used in the western countries but now India 
is adopting this also we are having a aggressive 
aerospace program we have space programs 
and we have jet engine programs we have missile 
programs All these all these is powered by 
a common denomination is the combustion 
And these combustors often have what is called 
combustion instability What is shown in the 
slide is a clipping from the wall street journal 
some years back may be about years back 
So we in our in the eighties nitric acid rain 
was considered to be a serious problem and 
everybody was trying solutions for that and 
then the engineers and scientists came up 
with the solution that we have to use combustors 
which give no anoxia that is nitric oxide 
NO NO and NO 
And the solution was to lean premix premier 
vapor burner LPP burners and these combustors 
were made and they were brought to the field 
and then what happened they had instability 
You can see that the when the combustion equability 
occurred loud amplitude of sound came inside 
the combustor and very large level of vibrations 
were set in we can see this is a article says 
turbine makers are caught in innovation trap 
So when the instability of curve you see 
the bolts were found to have cracked inside 
the spinning engines and dangerous vibrations 
heat chills came loose ring burner sounds 
loudly because gas flames causing serious 
vibrations parts were coming loose nuts and 
bolts were coming loose flying off And engine 
have to be shut down and it to shutdown it 
tales quite long time because they are very 
nice bearings it takes half an hour to shut 
down and half an hour to restart So this 
is really a tremendous problem in the industry 
and so a so on those engines that create ah 
that accuse to generate a power is shutdown 
it cause lot of money and this causes lot 
of revenue loss to the power companies 
In fact power companies asks the turbine companies 
the gas turbine companies make this engines 
to pay for this power loss that is happening 
due to a shutdown because of instability 
The gas turbine companies suffer very severe 
severely because this of course then this 
cost is built into their pricing So in general 
billions of dollars are lost because this 
problem and it is a very serious problem in 
the gas turbine industry Particularly in 
the recent times gas turbines are used for 
power production in ground base gas turbine 
engines 
Also in aero space program it is a really 
a very serious plaguing problem in rockets 
we have really high performance but we can 
imagine in a rocket typical rocket motor 
the mean pressure in the rocket would be about 
bar And even if you have like a one percentage 
oscillation or two percentage oscillation 
we still have about a bar oscillation and 
which is really loud 
And these rockets are not designed typically 
with any of those consideration but there 
design for performance and incredibly performing 
machine can have severe instability problem 
and can have loud levels of noise inside the 
rocket weather it is solid rocket or liquid 
rocket or it can happen barium jet or jet 
engine This can lead to severe vibrations 
that can have very severe structural problems 
and we can have increased heat transfer to 
the walls which can actually create problem 
to a walls you can have altering of burn rates 
we can have thrust oscillations very large 
thrust oscillations which can actually take 
a toll on the vehicle 
Also even the oscillations are very low amplitude 
the oscillations can actually perhaps create 
damage to the satellite because due to the 
loud the electronic which can not take this 
kind of loud vibrations or some of the systems 
in the rocket may actually lock on to frequency 
For example navigation system may have vibrated 
the frequency and may get completely damaged 
So any of these possibilities can lead to 
a serious compromise machine and we can have 
a machine failure in fact those who have 
studied history of the U S space program would 
know that a fire engine had very severe instability 
problem And America pumped in lot of dollars 
to fix this problem The mass lander originally 
was designed with no alumina that we do not 
want to pollute the mass environment but 
the lander the fire had very serious instability 
problem and in the end they used lot of aluminum 
in the rocket percent actually to shutdown 
the stability because instability problem 
was really compromising the program itself 
So what causes combustion instability ? Combustion 
can be unsteady phenomena combustion also 
make sound in fact even if you see drive 
leaves burn you will see that they crackle 
and make sound So this sound that is produced 
by combustion if you if you look at burner 
you go to a tea shop and look at the burner 
the burner actually makes a harms and makes 
sound this in general in power plants or 
an engines this flames combustion is usually 
happening in a enclosed environment So what 
happens is the sound that is generated by 
the combustion they travel to the walls get 
reflected and come back And this sound when 
it comes back they affect the flame and flames 
become unsteady now the unsteady flame produces 
further sound which goes and comes back and 
intern affects the flame further 
So this kind of sets up a feedback where 
in the sound actually makes the flame unsteady 
and the unsteady flame makes sound So there 
is some kind of feedback between these two 
which positive feedback can be set in between 
the acoustic oscillation acoustic feel and 
the combustion both in forcing each other 
And this can actually lead to this problem 
called combustion instability or the more 
acoustics instability and this is a very 
very serious problem What happens is that 
when the instability occurs oscillations grow 
in the very large amplitude ? Of course they 
will the amplitude the oscillation to saturated 
the limit cycle either a low amplitude limit 
cycle or it will be two loud that the hardware 
gets broken and so on 
So the oscillations actually you can see 
the grow and could reach limit cycle but 
even if you have you can have large amplitude 
oscillation which can for example destroy 
something like rocket engine or so on but 
sometimes even we have low amplitude oscillation 
these oscillation they are sustained and they 
are over a very large period Now this gas 
turbines which are producing power they operate 
for years and the low amplitude vibration 
itself can actually cause lots of fatigue 
to the ah the plans or the turbine blades 
or the pipes so on and can cause crack Here 
for this example a clack inlet to a gas turbine 
engine So you can have such failures in gas 
turbine engines and in aero space program 
you can actually have a really machine failures 
and so on So this have been this phenomena 
has been non force some time 
And the first engineer stuff is the V bomber 
which called buzz bomber which was used in 
world war by the Germans just used a pulse 
jet engine Although we do not use this kind 
of a engines any more this is a demonstration 
of pulsating combustion or combustion instability 
but here they are used in a sustain manner 
to make propulsive system Although pulse 
combustions are still there now they find 
a applications in creating low carbon monoxide 
a low notes burners and there is also lots 
of interest now in thermo acoustics engines 
and refrigerators So what causes combustion 
instability ? 
Combustion instability is a consequence of 
the interactions between flame flow and acoustics 
So there is three pillars or to it three 
icons to it there is flame dynamics that is 
how the flame responds to the flow and oscillations 
there is what dynamics or fluid mechanics 
which is affected by the combustion which 
is also affected by the acoustic oscillation 
For example in the case of burner which has 
voltage shedding in it in block body stabilize 
bond or something the acoustic feel will 
surely affect the mechanics fluid mechanics 
will intern affect the combustion And the 
combustion in tern affects the acoustic feel 
similarly the vortex dynamic acoustic the 
affect the acoustic feel So there is like 
a strong wake up link can happen between the 
flame flow and acoustics which is what drive 
the thermo acoustic engines 
So what causes instability how does the 
energy come in to the acoustic feel from the 
combustion ? Combustion adds the energy to 
the acoustic feel if it is in face with the 
pressure oscillation so this was given by 
Lord Rayleigh in about more than hundred years 
back in the so called famous Rayleigh criteria 
so if you have a pressure wave which is there 
and if it can go on and on But you know if 
you add heat when a pressure is at a maxima 
then the amplitude of the wave will grow and 
then again you add So in this hand waving 
crude example where we are talking about a 
instant heat release and if the heat release 
happens at the pressure maxima then amplitude 
oscillations can go and you can keep on growing 
Whereas if you actually add heat when then 
pressure is at minima you can see that the 
amplitude with the oscillation will actually 
come down Opposite is also true when you 
have oscillations and you add if you remove 
heat at the minima then you can actually 
end up driving the oscillations which is opposite 
So in general combustion adds energy to the 
acoustic feel if it is an face with the perception 
fluctuation the combustion oscillations are 
out of face with acoustic feel then you actually 
have damping the combustion will take away 
the acoustic energy So this is called a 
relay criteria we can express mathematically 
as follows rate of change of acoustic energy 
is dependent on the amount of heat that is 
added at this is proportional to the co relation 
between the acoustic pressure and the heat 
release minus the losses So this we will 
derive in the subsequent lectures in a detailed 
manner So if heat is added in face with the 
acoustic feel the oscillation will grow if 
it is added out if face the oscillation the 
oscillations will decay that is the that is 
the basic criteria 
Now acoustics affects various process in 
a combustion any time there is oscillation 
for example if you have the pressure going 
up and down that is the way acoustic oscillations 
happen pressure goes up and down acoustics 
goes up and down When the pressure goes up 
and down the pressure difference for example 
that drives the fuel fluoride will be going 
up and down So if the pressure in the chamber goes up and down the flow rate can also go 
up and down because the pressure or the delta 
p which drown the flow rate is going up and 
down 
So there is really a the thus really a direct 
affect from the acoustic on the various acoustic 
feel on the various process But the thing 
is it is not instantaneous it happens at a 
time delay lets say in this example of pressure 
oscillations affecting the flow rate the 
pressure oscillation combustion take some 
time to travel to the injector And then the 
injector oscillator flow at the injector has 
to oscillate then the fuel and the air has 
to come to the combustor where the burning 
happens So there is a time delay the wave 
travelling here and the flow travelling back 
to the to the combustion zone so that is the 
time delay 
So the various process similarly there could 
be proper evaporation in a combustor or a 
vortex shedding in a combustor So all these 
are various process so you can see if the 
pressure is oscillation shown by this pulse 
various process and the combustor can be shown 
in they may be happening in the delay So 
if the delay is such that it happens like 
a one cycle delay then then it will be face 
with the next pressure pulse and your oscillation 
can dry can be driven but if it is such that 
your not a if you are not in phase with the 
pressure oscillation 
Let us say the delays are something else like 
in this process and then you do not 
contribute to growth of oscillations but 
here for example the process one is in phase 
with pressure because the delay of the process 
one is same as the time period And then you 
can drive the oscillations you can of course 
also have complicated effect where you are 
delay may be the order of the harmonics of 
the combustor And then you could perhaps 
end up driving the higher notes of the combustors 
So if the delay is just right you are in 
trouble your oscillation can be built up and 
just to give up a idea of the time scales 
involved 
You can see the acoustics period of hertz 
oscillation is of the order of second 
acoustic period of five hundred oscillation 
this is the order of seconds chemical 
equation delay is the order of second 
If you have equal ratio if you consider 
ratio of you can say it is the order of 
seconds If you look at a convention 
convention is a low phenomena it happens much 
lower speed the speed of the flow but never 
the less the distance over which the convention 
happens is also very small 
So the acoustic feel is spread over the entire 
combustor which is the order of meter or meters 
were the conventional For example from the 
fuel injected flames will happen over centimeter 
centimeter So although the speed is lower 
the distance over which the convicted disturbance 
have to travel is also much much lower Therefore 
there you end up having parity of times scale 
although the speed are very despaired So 
the change in the length scale so you convection 
of a disturbance of meter per second over 
a distance of centimeter is of the order 
of second which happens to be the same 
as that of a hertz oscillation 
hertz oscillation is there and the disturbance 
of meter per second travelling over 
centimeter you are having a parity of time 
scale and you can end up having stability 
The convection of a disturbance over centimeter 
meter per second happens to second 
which is in line with this five hundred hertz 
oscillation The evaporation of micron 
hydro carbon droplet is of the order of 
seconds which is slightly shorter time skills 
So it could work with a higher frequency 
a micron droplet takes seconds so 
it depends on the size of the droplet what 
is the time scale involved in evaporation 
And therefore it could interact with a appropriate 
frequency if the length scale of the combustor 
is giving that kind of frequency Propagation 
of acoustic disturbance of centimeter 
centimeter meter per second this 
seconds is very short but you know that in 
acoustics the length scalars matters the line 
of the combustors which is of the order of 
meters meters So then time scale that 
is involved is second kind of thing liquid 
jet brake up another thing 
There are so many phenomena happen and each 
have time scales and when the acoustic time 
scale come close to the time scale of this 
process And then the delay of the process 
is of the order of the period of the acoustics 
then we are prone to tending instability 
So typical instability evaluation looks like 
this you have amplitude small amplitude oscillations 
which grow which keeps on growing and then they reach some kind of limit cycle So the 
oscillations first grow they go very rapidly 
they grow exponentially but then they tale 
of amplitudes do not grow further because 
the as the oscillation grow you entering nonlinear 
regime and nonlinear oscillation they tend 
to attend limit cycle 
They are also quite tonal that is you have 
a crisp frequencies occurring you have very 
crisp for your transforms if you look at it 
and the well defined frequencies are suppose 
to broadband sound Broadband sound does have 
combustion when the instrument dosent happen 
that is generally referred to as roar or a 
combustion noise and so on 
But when the instabilities occur you have 
very precise frequencies hundred hertz or 
two hundred hertz some time many harmonics 
also occur but they are clear tones You 
know that tone would be like when you play 
flute you have crisp sound or when you play 
whistle you have crisp sound that kind of 
toner sound is what is usually there in instability 
So combustion responds to the perturbations 
in flow and acoustics and in turn drives these 

So here is a picture of various phenomena 
that can combustor which I have borrowed from 
professor so you have heat links fluctuation 
and heat release fluctuation acts as a volume 
and source sound So they act as resource 
sound create acoustic sound waves and there 
are so many things happen the acoustic wave 
could affect the air or the fuel supply And 
you can up if you have were pressure oscillation 
can actually change the flow rate of the fuel 
because delta p changes If you have a air 
flows relations your flow rate of ah air itself 
can change because the velocity is oscillating 
and this can cause 
For example equal ratio fluctuations because 
you are having a the fuel flow rate oscillate 
and air flow rate oscillate equal ratio itself 
is fluctuating which will lead to heat fluctuation 
lead to further volume source of sound which 
will keep building the feedback You can have 
equivalent structure which can modulate the heat release and heat release can occur certain 
periodic manner And this modulation will 
make the heat release fluctuate all this is 
complicated but the coupling with ah turbulent 
flow and the flame week link of occurs and 
so on And we can also have entropy ways which is 
also driving the sound when the pressure 
wave come and go into a conversion diversion 
nozzle or something where the flow is accelerating 
the sorry the if you have hot spots from the 
combustor which is the entropy wave they 
come into the nozzle And go through this 
accelerating flow they actually get reflected 
as a acoustics pressure waves So you can 
have combustion instability happening by this 
entropy entropy waves which interact with 
the accelerating flow 
We can have vortex shedding driving heat release 
why does vortex shedding combustor ? In a typical 
combustor let\u2019s see gas turbine combustor 
you want to have flow happening at Mack number 
or a and the flame speed lamner flame 
speed of hydro carbons are typically of the 
order of meter per second or smaller even 
if you are a turbulent flow you can get it 
up to a meters But never the less we can not 
hold the flame at hundred meter per second 
and so on 
So then we have to have some kind of flame 
holding mechanism so a typical flame holding 
mechanism could be to use a backward spacing 
staff and one would be to use a smaller and 
you have a vortex break down And reason there 
can be a central toridal decirculation and 
so on where you can hold the flame or you 
can have like in after burner we can have 
v gutters where the flame is cell So all 
this is a mechanism for flame go flame holding 
basically some kind of flow separation happens 
and in this separated flow in the recirculating 
flow there will be hot ridicules which are 
their velocities And this ridicules help 
to hold the flame so in a practice combustor 
you have some kind of flame holding mechanism 
either under form of a solar which creates 
vortex breakdown or a backward spacing step 
or V gutter or or or block body something 
like that 
Now any time you have this thing for example 
if you would have backward spacing step you 
actually have vortices being shed at this 
step and the vortex shedding is a periodic 
phenomena Now you have a flue mixture coming 
typically fuel will be injected very close 
to the step So you have a fuel mixture coming 
it comes with the vortex periodically comes 
and sheds and burning gets modulated by this 
vortex shedding same thing can happen a block body combustor with a vortex vortex shedding 
can periodically modulate the modulate the 
burning In addition if you have using a sole 
flow what can happen is the ah the sole flow 
can have instabilities such as the precising 
vortex core and so on 
So the precising vortex core happens at it 
precise at certain frequency and therefore 
instability can happen that frequency So 
in general the combustion the fuel packet 
comes with this vertex and burns and therefore 
vertex shedding can drive heat release oscillation 
and this is one possible mechanism with which 
heat release oscillation fluctuation can give 
can happen heat release fluctuation in acoustic 
can give raise to heat release oscillation 
Now what happens is when there is sound and 
vortex shedding vortex shedding can get synchronies 
get locked to the acoustic feel and will look 
at this mechanism in more detail later course 
So this kind of coupling vortex shedding 
and the acoustics and the heat release that 
gives us instability 
Another mechanism is the entropy mode so the 
entropy waves the combustion has hot packets 
of high or temperature sports coming and 
they come in to the nozzle through which accelerating 
So when this entropy waves come they get 
reflected back as pressure and so you do have 
pressure oscillations coming back and they 
can come here and again you can get a feedback 
loop So you can in addition to the pure 
thermo stick mode you should search for but 
you can also have entropy modes which can 
also drive oscillations in a thermostatic 
engine but this necessarily this happens 
in engine where the flow is choked 
So therefore entropy mode both the entropy 
mode and thermo acoustic mode should be accounted 
for an one should check for this things 
Now I will give you example of another example 
I was mentioning earlier that when this ah 
lean preamp burners where were build as a 
solution for the acid rain that you want to 
make low nox burner So we wanted to you 
know you want to pre vaporize the fuel and 
mix it and you basically a premix combustor 
and so on this developed lot of in instabilities 
when this was brought on operation What happens 
is in a simple physical terms you have some 
kind of fluctuations here they come here and 
the pressure oscillation cause a fluctuating 
pressure difference or a delta p 
So the flow rate oscillates so when the pressure 
in the combustors low a rarefaction wave comes 
here And therefore the pressure delta p 
increases so the fluoride increases When 
the compression wave comes the delta p decreases 
and the flow rate comes down So you have 
a oscillating flow rate so oscillation flow 
rate can actually lead to oscillating flow 
rate of fuel can lead to oscillating heat 
release Similarly when the oscillation come 
here the air flow through the air duct ah 
will oscillate to you have both simultaneously 
fuel flow oscillations as well as air flow 
oscillations which intern leads to some kind 
of equivalence ratio fluctuations 
So you have a pockets of fuel air mixtures 
they come here and they are coming of course 
there is a time delay in time which acoustics 
waves are coming here and this mixture is 
convicted here So the there is some kind 
of modulation of equation ratio which results 
in the modulation of heat release rate and 
this can intern get in phase with the acoustic 
oscillation and lead to large amplitude oscillation 
this was big problem in the \u2019s when people 
developed this burners which were to operate 
in the lean limit the lean limit the combustion 
the combustion is very unstable So we have 
to go away from the linear limit to make it 
stabilize So equivalence ratio fluctuation 
are a big factor in driving instabilities 
in lean premixed premier priced burner in 
summary 
If you take a candle and you put in front 
of a woofer you can try it at home just take 
a simple candle and put it in front of a woofer 
And let\u2019s play some music in the woofer 
you can see actually the candle flickers you 
know it respond to high frequency also but 
low frequency you can observe with your eyes 
Similarly if you take a boons and burner 
flame and put a woofer next to it you will 
actually see flame in front wrinkle 
So in a the oscillations and they cause the 
frames to wrinkle these are pictures borrowed 
from and sorry these wrinkle happen in the 
wrinkle propagate up And when in premix flame 
the heat list depends on their amount of flow 
that is going through because there is flame 
and premixed reactants reactants in the air 
oscillations are coming through the flame 
So the amount of heat this depends on the 
surface area so when the wrinkle surface area 
oscillating So in the surface area oscillating 
due to wrinkles your heat release fluctuation 
heat release itself is oscillating causing 
heat release fluctuation 
So you put a tube around the this boon burner 
you will hear very nice toner sound so it 
is a very simple device but you can actually 
get very nice oscillating acoustic feel very 
very nice acoustic and this is at another 
mechanism for making thermo acoustic oscillation 
So in some flame kinematics is an important 
mechanism of instability in premixed burners 
that is the flame wrinkles with the oscillation 
and the wrinkles cross the flame area to fluctuate 
and the flame areas fluctuating the heat 
release oscillations fluctuates So how do 
we analyze thermo acoustic stabilities ? So 
we have to write some kind of equations and 
we have to solve them so how do you study 
fluid mechanics we write conservations of 
mass momentum and energy So acoustics is 
some kind of fluid mechanics acoustic is a 
branch of a fluid mechanics those also derived 
from in the same way we studied fluid mechanics 
except that we have to write the unsteady 
equation we write the unsteady equation conservation 
equations 
First for mass then for momentum and then 
for energy and then we work with these equations 
and derive a wave equation 
So classically we linearize the equation 
and then we do some algebraic manipulations 
and derive the wave equation So in a typical 
classical wave equation the right hand side 
term is that is d square p by d t square 
minus c square times d x square equal to 
that is a classical wave equation that is 
been studied over and over for last few hundred 
years Now you have some kind of term and 
the right hand side there is a simplistic 
form but here this term on the right hand 
side mod else the heat release from combustion 
So now the issue is how to model this heat 
release we have to have some kind of model 
link or the flame and the effect of acoustic 
on the flame that causes the un study acoustic 
heat and that has to be input in this wave 
equation And then you have to solve for it 
and how do you solve for it ? 
Typically in practical combustion it is solved 
using what is called network modules So in 
network modules we have you have a typical 
combustor as combustors as various components 
like fuel supply air supply burner flame 
and combustors So you write equations for 
each of this so you have some kind of input 
output relation for the fuel supply which 
is described in terms of some kind of transfer function So you have transfer function for 
each of these element and you put them to 
gather we will learn this in the later part 
of the course And then we write a series 
of equations to gather and typically these 
equations are linear equation 
So we then take this equation and solve for 
the Eigen values for the network model And 
if the Eigen values are complex then we can 
look at the imaginary part of the Eigen values 
and then see if your combustor is going to 
be unstable or stable easier said than that 
but we will go over it in the later part of 
the course 
So if the imaginary if the frequency is complex 
as I have described complex Eigen value happens 
then we have a the complex frequency real 
part and the imaginary part real part if you 
express omega a pi f plus i times alpha 
So this f denotes the periodic component 
of the oscillations and alpha denotes the 
growth rate as we will see now So if you 
write p prime which is the pressure fluctuates 
as p hat e power i omega t so this we can 
substitute expression here from a omega as 
p hat e power minus i into power f plus 
i alpha t which can be reconsidered as p hat 
times e for minus pi f t 
So you can see there is a periodic component 
then there is a so here is a i periodic there 
is no i here so this is a exponential growth 
or decay So this term in blue that is a 
periodic component which is what the real 
part of frequency in decades and the imaginary 
part of frequency indicates the exponential 
growth or decay So in summary we can saw 
for the Eigen value look at the imaginary 
part of the Eigen value and look at the grown 
rate the growth rate is indicating the Eigen 
vectors are going exponentially then you are 
in trouble because the there is instabilities 
Eigen vectors are decaying 
All the Eigen decaying exponentially there\u2019s 
no problem it is going to be stable but one 
of the Eigen vectors is growing exponentially 
then you have instability or you are prone 
to instability So this is the standard way 
of studying combustion instability using network 
model different people call it by different 
terms So we looked at how we looked at how 
instabilities occur 
Now we see whether we can suppress these 
instabilities so how do we suppress combustion 
driven oscillations 
See first the two way you can suppress one 
is to eliminating the coupling between heat 
release and the acoustic field So I said 
that the instabilities happen because the 
acoustic feel is coming in phase with combustion 
there are positive feedback So if you can 
eliminate coupling between heat release and 
acoustic feel that is a simple way of eliminating 
the thermo acoustic oscillations Now easier 
said than they done but quite difficult and 
how do we do this so I mentioned about the 
time scales involved in the previous process 
So let us say we have a injector which responds 
to acoustic oscillation and the character 
stick time are matching with the acoustic 
frequency So either you can change the acoustic 
time scale that mean changing the length of 
the combustor which may be often very difficult 
because it is a big thing its already built 
you can not change it So then if you want 
to change the diameter of the droplets or 
if you change the nozzle if you change the 
diameter of the nozzle when you are actually 
altering the time scale of the droplet evaporation 
So in this case that would be a easier solution 
or in the LPP burners that I described you 
have a time delay dependence on the distance 
between the injector and the combustion time 
zone So one possibility to change the location 
of the injector or alter the injection velocities 
or change the flow speeds So all this will 
alter the time place so you have to come 
up with some way to disturb the coupling between 
the heat release and the acoustic feel And 
typically we have the idea of the time delays 
and you alter the time delay and the coupling 
will get disrupted and typically it is easier 
to change the injector or something rather 
than change the combustor itself 
So this is the this is the way of so when 
the oscillations you make sure that the oscillations 
do not come at all Now in order to practice 
this approach even before the combustors is 
design that means you have good stability 
analysis to rules if you have them you can 
check for instabilities even before you fabricate 
the combustor If you done have them if the 
instabilities are happening then you check 
for the time scales and alter the time scales 
The next possibility is to have damping so 
you can take the attitude let the oscillations 
be there and I will take them out by observing 
them So it is like in you know in studios 
you have perforated walls which will absorb 
the sound so you can have perforated liners 
we use that in the engines or in solid rocket 
motors you have lot of aluminum in it It 
solves fold purpose the aluminum actually 
burns to form alumina and alumina gives a 
very high specific impulse the performance 
of the rocket is improved but alumina also 
serves a very important other purpose That 
is these alumina which ah which is more turn 
and it it droplet moving they actually take 
out sound energy 
So the droplet actually go back in force 
with oscillations and take of course the 
sound feel and that is all they move when 
you have a oscillation and the droplet moving 
they are moving they are taking the energy 
of the sound filed If there are significant 
amount of alumina then lot of acoustic feel 
can be absorbed so these are classical practice 
used in space rockets rockets are used to 
get to space to make sure instabilities do 
not happen in fact typical rockets have something 
of the order percentage aluminum loading 
Although in missiles you sometimes may not 
be add aluminum because you do not want to 
have alumina so that you can avoid the signature 
then those rockets will be more prone to instability 
You can have other mechanism like putting 
baffles and so on 
We have a region of high acoustic velocity 
and put a baffle so that you take out the 
maxima you disrupt the acoustic feel somehow 
take away the energy out So the this would 
be so that like I said that two ways of removing 
the acoustic make sure that does not generate 
by disturbing the coupling between the acoustic 
and combustion The other thing is let the 
sound be produced but will upset all of it 
by using damping material 
Another strategies using distributed time 
delay is the various combustors like in annual 
combustors there will be so many burners 
and we can have time delay associated with 
each of them to different So that they do 
not act all to gather in big bang but they 
are act with the distributed time delay so 
you don\u2019t get a very strong acoustic feel 
because you have the affect being dispersed 
or distributed 
So there are various ways of removing the 
stability typically in practice in stability 
occurs then only people notice it Although 
we are trying to design for combustor which 
without instability and some people we call 
them residence black magicians who are who 
are called in when there is a instability 
problem comes and fix it And this and then 
you will do some adobe measure and fix it 
and then in a what is wrong with it is any 
time you change something when the instabilities 
comes and you do something remove instability 
takes a tool on the performance And lot of 
combustors most large number of combustors 
have lot of instability problem but the company 
is which make them they do not like to speak 
a word because it is very bad publicity so 
this is seldom talked about 
Now the last part is about active control 
can we use some ideas of anti sound to suppress 
the instability So you must have seen bosh 
speakers and so on where you put them on and 
you sit in a aeroplane you do not hear anything 
or factories your speakers actually cancel 
the sound and you reduce the amplitude of 
the sound So can we have some such concept 
in thermo acoustics where you are having 
a active control So let the sound reproduce 
all actively suppress it rather than having 
a passenger control is so far people prefer 
the engineers prefer passive control because 
they are more robust The problem with passive 
control is each measure works for some kind 
of frequency range not for all frequency 
range Whereas the active control should be 
able to in principle suppress any sound although 
it\u2019s far from deployed in the industrial 
sense 
So it simple scheme given by mcmanus point 
seven candle in their various famous 
paper and progress in energy and combustion 
sciences is given below So the combustor 
you mess up the pressure in the combustor 
using a micro phone or a piezo electric fluctuate 
then you pass it through a time delay generator 
amplifier So you amplify this signal but 
you also delay and you then feed this signal 
to activate it and actuator actually introduces 
let\u2019s say velocity fluctuations You can 
have actuator simple simplistic actuator would 
be a loud speaker so which we will have diaphragm 
and it will introduce a velocity fluctuation 
in the combustor And this will be introduced 
such that the original you had a stable combustor 
but you put the fluctuation such that it cancels 
the affect of the instability 
So have originally unstable system but you 
have actually pushing the unstable eigen values 
to stable Eigen value so you make this activator 
vibrate such that the net system is stable 
So this is the concept in the very elementary 
sense this is very simple to say but it 
is quite hard to do it in a practice In reality 
the actual combustors employ that employ and 
active control of combustor instability has 
very complicated mechanism it is a very complex 
study by itself and it\u2019s very far from being 
perfected but will take a look at it in the 
course And so we can use active control to 
suppress the instability the very various 
forms of sophisticated control is that argues 
to suppress the some optic instabilities 
In reality we do not put loud speakers in 
the combustor because you know you can imagine 
if put a loudspeaker in a combustor loud speaker 
burn off because it is a very hot style environment 
combustors So what you do typically you 
can have a second refill injection which 
is pulse you can have Now you have very 
high bandwidth fuel injection pulse fuel in 
an unsteady manner to the combustion chamber 
And you send the second refill it produce 
a second refill heat release The phase of 
the fuel pulses is arranged such that you 
have the secondary heat release fluctuations 
these fluctuations are out of phase acoustic 
feel and you can actually show that there 
is very small amount of secondary heat release 
fluctuations can actually produce serious 
amount of amount of damping in the system 
So in summary the combustion instability 
in summary combustion instabilities very dangerous 
with catastrophic consequences you can have 
a the whole engine being destroyed or you 
can have slow and slow failure by fatigue 
We say that combustion instability happens 
between the because the coupling between the 
heat release and sound and this positive 
feedback is what is causing the combustion 
instability thermo acoustic instability if 
like this one reason why we study acoustics 
So we have to have a good knowledge acoustic 
because what is involved is sound that is 
produced by combustion how it interacts with 
the combustion So we have to study two thing 
that is why the first half of the course deals 
with acoustics how does sound propagate and 
then we have to study how combustion generate 
sound That is how the acoustic feeds back 
with the combustion and produces how do the 
combustion produces acoustic feed 
We discuss various mechanism in different 
combustions we have a different mechanism 
that include For example vortex shedding 
and entropy fluctuations flame kinematics 
droplet evaporation unsteady drop evaporation 
and steady droplet evaporation there are various 
different mechanisms that cause combustion 
instability and we saw that when the combustion 
is in phase with the pressure So the pressure 
oscillations affect the combustion fluctuation 
and there is a delay and if the combustion 
oscillation are in phase with the acoustic 
feed in phase with the acoustic pressure specific 
you get the onset of instabilities 
And we saw that these instabilities can be 
analyzed you sing the so called network models 
which are what is used in practical industrial 
burners And we use we can use passive control of instability which is what is used in the 
often in practice that is either do something to damp the oscillation by putting some muffler 
or liners so on Or you do something to the 
injector or the fuel location or something 
and affect the coupling or we can also have 
a very sophisticated active control where 
you use fine activators which are driven by 
controllers which can actually affect the 
sound 
So in summary I have given a introduction 
to what is combustion driven oscillation and 
how it occurs and propulsive systems and industrial 
combustors and so on So then about lectures 
we will have on acoustics it is how we explain 
we derive the equation acoustic and study 
the equation and so on And then the next 
lecture will be on how combustion produces produce a sound In the next class we will 
speak about we start with acoustics we stick 
with what the very elementary acoustics and 
then we go on to deriving the equations of 
the acoustics deriving the wave equations 
and the solutions for it so that is the end 
of lecture one 
Thank you 

' ] [ u'As we saw in the last class we saw that were happening because of the feedback between 
the acoustic field and the process and 
combustors and power plants 
and we also look at the consequences of the aerospace propulsion 
system Then we looked at different mechanism which are responsible for crossing this feedback 
and how we could control this oscillations 
either passively or actively 
So the subject has is basically because of 
coupling between acoustic and combust ants 
so it is important that we build up a good 
background acoustics So the first part of 
the class as I mentioned lass time deals with a acoustics So acoustics deals with generation 
propagation and effects of sound we will be speaking generally about the first to last 
text 
Generation and propagation although a lots 
of research work on the effects of sound on 
various things like the subjects like psychological acoustics and so on Lot of study on how sound 
effects new born babies how sound affects the moods of people how sound how the environmental 
sound effect the mood of the community and so on We did not look at that we will restrict 
ourselves to generation and propagation in 
fact it is much easier to study the propagation 
of sound rather than generation sound because generation sound is a much more complicated 
topic So it is easier to do easy things 
first so we will start out with how sound 
propagates then we will look at how sound 
is generated 
So I must also emphasize that sound should not be a miss normal consequences in the range 
of human perception that is we can hear some sound We should not restrict the definition 
of sound it can fall into definition of sound 
can be a lot more general than that sound 
could be defined as the disturbance of pressure You could say even more general way disturbance 
of normal stress which propagates a finite 
speed in a compressible medium and compressible 
medium could be solid or liquid or gas We 
will be mainly dealing with gas in this course 
let me write down this definition So we 
say that sound is like a disturbance or pressure 
or even more general stress normal stress 
which propagates at finite speed in a compressible 
medium It can be solid or liquid or gas 
so in in this class we are going to primarily 
deal with this so we can also have study 
propagation of sound and clause mass and also 
things like photon gas and so on Sound is 
definition of much more than general what 
we think that is in terms of what we can perceive on us 
So in this class we are studying how sound 
propagates in gases because in combustors 
we have gases we have fuel and burning and producing product of combustors carbon dioxide 
and water vapor So all this is gas we are 
looking to study propagation of sound in gases 
medium so there are basically you must be 
knowing you must studied in school that two 
types of wave they are longitudinal waves 
as well as transverse wave two types of waves 
We can say longitudinal and transverse so 
a longitudinal waves is more like series of 
compression and refraction propagation 
So you can have a mechanical energy in which 
you think of some kind of spring which you 
compress and then the compression propagates 
then verification propagation So if I draw 
a picture so let us say I have a spring this 
way and compress it and I could have reigns 
where this spring is very compressed followed 
by regions where it is verified So you 
can have compression regions and verification 
regions followed by compression region So 
this is like the mechanical analogy of sound 
you can all also have transverse waves electromagnetic 
waves of transverse wave but in general a 
gasses do not support that 
Although strictly speaking that that segment 
is true only for inverse force but in general 
we have compression verification waves which 
is the longitudinal waves happening in gasses 
and what we are going to study about So 
we are primarily dealing with longitudinal 
wave propagation we can have another example 
of transverse waves would have a vibrating 
string You take a guitar and plot the string 
and you take a cloth line and plot the string 
you can get waves like this 
So here the direction of motion the direction 
of the propagation of the wave is in this 
direction but the particle is moving perpendicular 
to it So that is what happens in transverse 
wave in transverse wave you have this particle 
motion perpendicular to the direction of motion 
wave in a compression or ratification wave 
It is a longitudinal wave you have the wave 
propagating and this motion of the gas particles 
also happen along the direction of the propagating 
So that is the main difference and we in 
sound is longitudinal waves that is the particle 
most along the direction of propagation to 
it So that is what we are going to study 
so let us look at the air as the medium 
So we have some kind of iamb impression the 
pressure here is one atmosphere and we are 
looking at disturbances about this ambient 
median So if you draw a graph let us say 
this is time and pressure so if you have 
squares and media that is if you have a silence you will have constant pressure silence is 
just constant atmospheric pressure Then 
you could have sound then the pressure will 
fluctuate and it may fluctuate like this like 
this or like this 
So you would have a variety of different 
frequencies so frequency is the rate at which 
the pressure fluctuates and you can also have a amplitude is the how much pressure fluctuate 
So we typically think of silence that is 
sound is above the silence the silence is 
there is a study base process pressure above which the pressure fluctuate So what are 
the different kinds of sounds that we experience in our daily life what is the decimal levels 
and so on So let us look at that so we 
basically think of pressure the total pressure 
in it pressure equal to it is a function of 
time as well as position time t r is position 
So we can think of it as base pressure p 
bar the over bar stands for the mean time 
average quantity plus t prime stand for the 
fluctuating quantity So this is the mean 
pressure or the base pressure 
this is the fluctuating pressure strictly 
speaking all fluctuating need not be sound 
You can also have fluctuating water city waves and entropy waves but now we are going to 
study about sound and this is the fluctuating pressure So we are only looking at the crystal 
component at this point so the minimum detectable pressure typically by human beings by the 
human ear is of the order of the order of 
power minus Pascal 
Of course it varies from different people 
to peoples some people can detect more sound 
then others some people can not but typical sounds that human can detect is 
minimum detectable sound by human this is 
the order of to the power minus Pascals So let us look at we will look at various 
types of sounds and so on so before we do that we have to look at two quantities one 
is amplitude the other one is frequency So 
amplitude is how much the fluctuation above 
the base pressure so that the amplitude though amplitude and frequency are the key characteristics 
that define the sound wave amplitude and frequency 
So amplitude is again how much the pressure 
fluctuate frequency is the number of oscillations 
per second of the acoustic wave that happens around the speed bar frequency So here we 
live the term acoustic pressure and fluctuating 
pressure in the changeably and the acoustic 
pressure is often defined in terms of log 
scale Now why do we include log scale because 
our human hearing is kind 
So if you double the volume in your loud 
speaker in your steroid phone you would not 
perceive it as a volume doubled so it is 
more than a scale because of that we have 
a definition of quality called decimals So 
acoustic pressure is measured in decimals 
it is decimal written as dB small d capital 
B so acoustic pressure and decimals is defined 
as log p over p reference to the base 
So we take logarithm of pressure divided 
by difference pressure with respect to the 
base and multiplied by what is the 
reference pressure in air the reference pressure 
is micro Pascals but is into power 
minus Pascals 
So we are dealing with air but in water 
we mention that reference pressure is one 
micro Pascal I mean it is just a convention 
So this is this reference is a typically 
epic that the lower sound the human that is 
the order of a lower sound the human ear can 
hear So here human ear can hear so next 
we speak about so typically the amplitude 
is expressed in decibels and frequency is 
denoted in herds so amplitude decibels and 
frequency herds 
So herds is same as cycles per second the 
number of cycles per second frequency is expressed 
as herds which is also called sometimes cps cycles per second So we have different type of 
sound we are audible sound which are not audible but are high frequency or frequencies which 
are very low which we can not see here So 
if you look at the spectrum so typical human 
beings can hear from hertz to kilo hertz so this is the audible range and below this 
there is infra sonic sound or infra sound 
and above this you have ultra sound So ultra 
sound is very important infra sound and both 
have application in various fields infra sound 
is an application in geo physics in terms 
of when you talk about earth quakes in its 
measurements 
So there is an infra sound to detect if in 
the ecological application were if some cities 
are buried inside you create sound wave low 
frequency sound waves and you try to repair 
what is reflected of and try to say if there 
is something like a arch logical site You 
have city hidden or something many animals 
can here have a different hearing range for 
example elephants can here low frequency 
sound some other animal Here high frequency 
sound and humans young people can hear from 
hertz to kilo hertz you grow older 
hearing deter ate 
So your range can get narrow ultra sound 
can also have lot application in doing things 
like mammogram were people are trying to detect 
cancer or ultra sound scanning where you 
try to look at whether the new born baby is 
healthy so on So we try to do a scan and 
you since sound see how the sound is scattered 
and reflected image and look at the picture 
to get the idea of health of the new born 
baby So typically acoustics deals with low 
amplitude sound the linear acoustics that 
mean the amplitudes are very low but when 
the amplitude is very high The acoustic wave 
would become steeper and steeper and you tend 
to found short wave 
So that is the subject of nonlinear acoustics 
in our class mostly we deal with linear acoustics 
low amplitude acoustics and not really with 
short waves So just to get a idea of various levels of sound involved so if you are talking 
about a calm breathing where somebody is sitting 
calmly and breathing you breathing itself 
is very fine That would be order of dB 
the normal conversation would be the order 
of dB perhaps to dB We have animated 
loud conversation that could be tending to 
dB city traffic could be around dB again 
It depends on which city and the loud Indian 
cities it many be slightly higher that complain 
that I would make around eighty dB and lawnmower 
would make dB 
The whistle of the train or the horn of the 
train if you are about feet away would 
also dB a train itself when it is moving 
its probably making about dB and 
would be around or to dB and your 
thrush hold of pain It is when the ear start 
hearting support dB and fire work would 
be like one dB So this is rough figure 
they are given just to give you a idea of 
the typical sound pressure seen in various 
day to day situations I think if you have 
anything louder than dB if you hear that 
kind of sound even you are in this ear there 
is serious danger of losing the hearing 
If you are even listening to rock concert 
regularly you are hearing will calm down 
in fact it study has shown that musician have 
low hearing because every day listening to 
very loud sound in their own concepts and 
sound So there is just a rough idea this 
is not our basic interest our interest is 
just study not to study about hearing and 
so on really to look at how sound propagates 
inside combustors For that we are trying 
to build up a background in acoustics theoretical 
acoustics so having said this we need to 
be able to quantitatively describe the propagation 
of sound we need 
Of course we need to quantitatively describe 
generation also first we are going to talk 
about quantitatively the propagation of sound 
so we need equations for that and that is 
the that is next half of this term 
So as I mentioned that we have to we are attempting to describe quantitative propagation of sound 
so when you want to describe something quantity we need a equation so the equation that describe 
quantity is the propagation of sound is the 
wave equation 
I just want to first of all write it so that 
you have a idea how it looks like most of 
you have seen it So this is the classical 
wave equation so this is an equation that 
is being studied by mathematicians for a long time and in very great detail So we are 
going to derive this from a fluid mechanics 
prospective this is how the subject actually 
acoustics started in the first derivation 
of wave equation from fluid mechanics Later 
on the other process to acoustics came but in this class we are going to describe it 
based on fluid mechanics 
In fact in the s this approach came back 
strongly because of the success of aero acoustics 
since acoustics were you have to deal with 
the generation sound and to the generation 
sound you have to study fluid mechanics So 
I think in this class we are eventually going 
to deal with generations of sound so we will 
stick with the fluid mechanics approach So to simplify matters I will be deriving this 
in one dimension in fact this equation that 
have written in this one space dimension a 
x but we can very easily do it for three 
dimensional In fact I will write down the 
results for three dimension so this is a 
partial differential equation 
popularly called PDE partial difference equation 
We are writing a partial differential equation 
for the acoustic pressure you can also write 
wave equation which will be another partial 
equation for acoustic velocity or the density 
and so on Although writing in terms of the 
partial is the most popular form now how 
do we derive this wave equation that is the 
next step to derive the wave equation We 
will use the basic equation of fluid mechanics 
what are the basic equation of fluid mechanics 
they are continuity equation momentum equation 
and energy equation 
So we use they are called conservation equations 
so for a gas we will also need a stat equation 
So we will use the moment we speak about 
continuity equation what comes to your mind 
is suddenly you think row A V is equal to 
constant So I am quite worried about this 
because we are condition to be thinking this 
is the conservation equation but you are 
dealing with This is true only for study 
flows only for study flows and acoustics 
is primarily an unsteady phenomena so we 
would be in quite bit of trouble 
If we use the equation row A V equal to constant we have to un condition ourselves to not to 
be using that We have use some other form of equation for continuity we should actually 
be able to deal with and that is the differential form or kinetic equation when you do not 
make the assumption that the flow is study So similarly we have to use the un study 
form of the momentum equation so I am not assuming any back ground on fluid mechanics 
So I will derive the continuity and momentum equations from scratch but I will not do 
the most general derivation I will do a simple one dimensional equation derivation of the 
one dimensional equation Now if I am interested you can go ahead and look at fluid mechanic 
text book to see how a general three dimensional 
equation for all kinds of situation could 
be derived but here I am going to restrict 
myself to just to one dimensional equation 
So we are looking at the mass conservation 
or the continuity equation so let us look 
at the one dimensional control volume and 
look at a station x and a station x plus d 
x and we see what happen to the flow that 
happens across these stations So we want 
to if you think about what should be the consideration 
law you can say that if suddenly mass product 
is coming in and mass product is going out 
The rate of change of mass florid in the control 
volume will be equal to the head of mass accumulation 
So mass florid in minus mass florid out equal 
to d by d t of mass in the control volume 
that is the very simple statement of conservation 
of mass So we are following a control volume 
approach you can also have particle approach 
Here we are going to follow a control volume 
approach or a oil arena approach so in this 
control volume which is bounded by x plus 
x delta x So we must emphasize that we are 
dealing with compressible flow we will say 
mass flow rate so that would be like mass 
flow per second in that is happening at x 
minus mass flow ray out which it will be at 
x plus dx delta x this should be equal So 
we take the cross areas one we can also take 
it as a or some kind of thing will simply 
keep it as as to keep things simple 
So this approach is the change of rate of 
mass in the control volume the volume is 
the control volume delta x times multiplied 
by density row you get the mass and rate 
of change of that is dou by dou t So we 
can ah write a tailor expansion so the mass 
fluoride would be row u times and the mass 
fluoride So this is what we need to look 
at so this row u of x plus d we can write 
it as dou of x minus dou of x plus dou by 
dou x dou u times So we can cancel this 
so this should be equal to dou by dou t delta extends 
We can re write this as sorry I missed a 
minus sign so I can re write it as delta 
x times dou by dou t of row as this is a universal law So whatever be the delta x we can choose 
we would satisfy this equation any choice 
of delta x so if that is the case then 
what is inside this bracket dou row by dou 
t plus dou by dou u should be equal to 
So let me write that here so for any delta 
x if this equality is valid then what is 
given here should be equal to 
So our continuity equation is dou e by dou 
t plus dou by dou x of row u equal to So 
this is our continuity equation in this if 
you write it in a vector form in the general 
d science it will be dou row by dou t plus 
del dot row u equal to U is now a vector 
and I would leave that u to derive this and 
if you were writing in the Einstein notation 
or the index notation Then we can write 
this as dou row by dou t plus dou by dou xi 
of row U i equal to sorry this is the vector 
form and this is the index notation correct 
this is one dimensional 
So now we have derived the conservation mass 
equation and the next step is to derive the 
conservation moment equation rather the conservation 
of linear momentum conservation of linear 
momentum So we must have studied in school 
that this can be expressed as f equal to ma 
that is the nutrients low but in a fluid 
we have written slightly differently So 
what we say is and we are going to do it in 
a Hilary frame work so what we can say is 
some of the external forces is equal to rate 
of change of momentum inside the control volume 
plus change in momentum flux across the boundaries 
So that is what the statement would be in 
the Hilary frame work and this can be this 
is equivalent to the usual statement in the 
frame work The theorems which shows the equivalence 
of that but I am not going to any of that 
but a standard class in include mechanics 
would deal with these things So let me write 
the statement 
some of external forces is equal to rate of 
change of momentum inside the control volume 
plus change in momentum flux across the control 
surface 
So whatever I have written words in the right 
hand side can be just written as in equation 
format dou by dou t of momentum inside plus 
momentum flux out minus momentum flux So 
this term dou by dou t term momentum insert 
plus momentum flux out minus momentum flux 
in that would be equal to the some of the 
external forces So let us try to evaluate 
what this term is in right hand side so this 
would be equal to again we consider a one 
dimensional duck with a unit cross section 
area this for convenience but you can have 
any cross section area and just find 
So this would be equal to 
one is the cross section area so row theta 
x that is the mass time times one that is 
the mass times u that is the momentum plus 
U square at x plus delta x minus row times 
U to the mass times velocity at x Now this 
should be equal to the external forces So 
the external forces are pressure forces plus 
discuss forces plus body forces and so on 
So we are not considering any body forces 
or visit forces we are looking at in visit 
fluid with no body forces and pressure force 
actually in acoustic propagation the pressure 
forces will be what is dominant 
So let us before that try to expand this 
term delta x plus cancel this term so this 
is the simple simplified form of the term 
now external forces equal to 
pressure forces plus forces plus body forces 
So we are not going to considered those two 
looking at in visit force with no body forces 
and so what is the net pressure force in the 
x direction so pressure times area is the 
force 
So here we are talking about unit area so 
p times so this would be equal to p at 
x minus p at x plus delta x whole thing multiplied 
by one because of unit area cross section 
So this can be written as p f x minus pressure 
at x plus dou p by dou x and dou delta x 
So this will cancel now if you collect these 
terms to gather then this plus this so you 
will get what you get now we can simplify 
this 
We write it nicely s p and again as I mentioned 
earlier this equation should be true for any 
arbitrary control volume space delta x So 
that means the term without delta x should 
be so we can write this as delta x times 
dou by dou t of row u plus dou by dou x of 
row u square plus dou p by dou So we should 
have this equation work for any arbitrary 
delta x so I will drop this and say that 
of the momentum equation this momentum equation 
is given and what is called the conservation 
form This is very important for solving a 
things numerically and computation dynamics 
this is the momentum equation in conservation 
form Now what we can do is to get this in 
terms of the raw variables and that is also 
quite useful 
So that would be let us expand in this term 
we can say row times dou u by dou t plus u 
times dou row by dou t plus u times dou by 
dou x of row u plus row u times dou u by dou 
x plus dou p by dou x equal to Now if 
you see this term these two terms can be clubbed 
to gather as u times dou row by dou t plus 
dou by dou x of row u In fact this total 
thing you see from here that this some of 
these terms is equal to 
This should be equal to so we can drop 
this term and you are left with just those 
terms So the momentum equation can now be 
written nicely in another form which is row 
dou u by dou t plus u dou u by dou x equal 
to minus dou p by dou x This is the one dimensional 
momentum conservation equation in terms of 
the row variables raw variables because these 
are the variables that you can measure directly 
So we can also write this in in the other 
forms so I can write this in a vector form 
as dou u by dou t u dot lu times row equal 
to minus del p in the index notation This 
would be row times dou U i by dou t plus u 
uj dou j of dou x this would be u dot del 
times U i equal to minus dou p by dou x i 
So this is the vector form this is the index 
notation or the Einstein convention and you 
have the one dimensional form here so let 
me write that write below so this will be 
our one dimensional form So now we have 
derived the equations of continuity momentum 
and next we need a relationship between pressure 
and density we need a pressure density relationship 
So there is a rule called two property rule 
in thermo dynamics a thermo dynamic state 
is defined by two thermo dynamic variables 
at some instantaneous time in a uniform flow 
and a single flow So you need two thermo 
dynamic variables to that is called two property 
rule 
you need two thermo dynamic variable to describe 
the system So we can say that for example 
p equal to is pressure is a equation of row 
comma entropy So these are let us say you 
specify density and entropy s equal to entropy 
row is density p equal to pressure 
So in sound propagation we assume that sound 
is propagating in an isentropic way so there 
is no there is no heat flow in and out of 
the particle no heat flow in and out if a 
fluid particle 
So we can say s equal to some reference quantity 
s not that is the entropy is not changing 
what we can say that is pressure equal to 
a function of row comma s not where s not 
is constant value to we say this is for 
isentropic sound propagation 
So we now have a relationship let us say 
p equal to p of row comma s not there is a 
unique relationship between the unique relationship 
between pressure and density So this is 
the state equation 
So to summaries what we have the full set 
of equation that we derive so we have the 
conservation of mass conservation and momentum 
conservation will be row times dou u by dou 
t plus u dou u by dou x equal to minus dou 
p by dou x So this is momentum conservation 
and we have p equal to p of row comma s not this is the state equation So we have these 
three equations this summary of the equation and we have conservation of mass momentum 
conservation and state equation So we have 
derived the basic equation of fluid mechanics 
now I did not derive the energy equation that 
is the reason for that 
In fact for simple situation we do not need 
it because we will see it later I will leave 
that equation for subsequent class why we 
have not going use energy equation although 
when you have a combusting kind of a situation 
Here there is non uniform temptation we will 
need to use the equation So we will eventually 
derive it but at the moment I try to keep 
thing simple energy deriving energy equation 
is little bit more complex 
So we have three equations now some of the 
things we want to see they are coupled equation 
because the variables appear in all the equation 
they are non linear see the terms row du 
by dx So you have non linear coupled partial differential equation that is what we have 
we have non linear coupled partial difference equation These equations have very limited 
number of equations and often we will have to solve the numerically but in linear acoustics 
we if we can lean rise this equation and write a linear Then we can actually derive the 
linear wave equation and then we may be able to get exact analytical solutions 
So that is what we will proceed to do in 
the next class what we do is we will leave 
lean arise the equation of mass and momentum and also lean arise the state equation that 
means we will write variable as a mean quantity plus fluctuating quantity This fluctuating 
quantity will have value which is much smaller than the mean quantity and then we will neglect 
product of two fluctuating quantities We 
will get this linear equation and couple them 
we will some algebraic manipulation and derive 
the linear wave equation and that that is 
what we do in next class 
So to summaries what we did is lecture we 
talked about what is acoustics what we talked 
little bit about what is there in the subject 
acoustics let us talk about what a wave is 
talked about amplitude and frequency Then 
we spoke about various kind of infra sonic 
sound and so on we spoke about practical 
situations where what the situation decibel 
levels that we see 
Then we said we will attempt to derive conservation 
of mass momentum excreta and then we will 
and we derive this things in a attempt to 
be able to derive the wave equation which 
we will do in the next class So you should 
work out this exercises in the first exercise 
I want you to do similar derivation for a 
variable area duct 
Here you have a general function a of x wining slowly with x and derive the following gone 
equation that is this continuity equation 
which is a first equation given in the slide 
Then the momentum equation the second equation 
given to slide and the last equation is the 
energy equation please do this it is quite 
a simple problem just do it carefully the 
final equation of water given here try to 
get this answer 
Then the next question is let us consider 
two acoustic sources that are in phase each 
of them individually produces as acoustic 
pressure amplitude of decibels what will 
be the amplitude of both of them If they 
are on simultaneous in the phase is a 
dB or is it something else you will be tempted to say the answer dB but what is it ? 
I will stop with this and have a good day 
we will now in the next lecture we will proceed 
to the wave equation first and then we get 
the solutions 
Thank you 

' ] [ u'Good day welcome to the third lecture on acoustic instabilities in aerospace propulsion 
the last class we talked about very basic 
of acoustics What is sound ? How sound is 
characterized in terms of frequency amplitude and so on And then we spoke about the definition 
of decibel and then we talked about various kind of sounds that we hear in our day to 
day life And what are the typical decibel 
levels and so on ? Then we said that we want 
to characterize sound the propagation sound mathematically So we are starting from the 
basic equations of fluid mechanics which is conservation of mass momentum and energy 
and so on and the state equation 
So we derived the conservation of mass which 
is the continuity equation and the momentum equation from basic first principles We also 
spoke about the state equation and so on 
Today we are going to talk about how we derived 
the wave equation from these equations ? So before I proceed to this let us start with 
a story So there was just a professor who 
was working very late and then he was trying 
to go home and he was let us say drunk and it was like some a m in the morning and 
he suddenly discovered that he has lost his 
married his or her marriage ring And then 
the professor decided to search for the marriage wedding ring And the professor was searching 
on the street and wherever he could we think he a wherever he thought it will be there 
And then comes a student graduation student was working very hard and he is seeing he 
saw the professor And he asked the professor professor What 
are you doing ? So late in the night Professor I lost my wedding ring and I am searching 
for it and the student said ok Let me try 
to help you I will join you and I will try 
to help you The student also wanted to impress the professor and so on So both professor 
student are starting to search for the professors wedding ring The professor was really want 
it because if he or she goes home the spouse will be very angry The professor can be man 
or woman does not matter and then pretty soon the student discovered that the professor 
searching for the wedding ring only under 
the lamppost 
So the student found this very amusing and he went and asked the professor professor 
is there any guarantee that you would have 
lost the wedding ring or what guarantee is 
there that you would have lost the wedding 
ring under a lamppost ? Its highly unlikely 
the professor said look I made a assumption I assume that the ring will be there under 
the lamppost Then the student ask I mean 
it is a very bad assumption the professor 
says this is the only place where I can look 
So I made the assumption that its under the 
lamppost So I look where I can 
So this is kind of true with our mathematical 
analysis also that is we make assumptions 
so that we can simplify things and we can 
deal with things So often the assumptions 
are not because they are the way it is We 
make assumptions so that we can do things with the equations and then we look for situations 
where the assumptions are applicable and then we say that the solutions were derived or 
the equations we have derived are applicable under these set of conditions and so on 
So we derive partial differential equation 
and there were couple partial differential 
equation and there were non linear and so 
on And I said that it was very hard to get 
very general solution for these things So 
the idea is that we need to get some solutions 
because we can not just sit there without any 
hope or helplessly and say that these are 
complicated equations we can do we can not 
do anything about it So we do the same thing 
that the professor did So we can look under 
the lamppost where he we can look 
So we make assumptions so that we can solve 
the equations that we have derived under whatever 
conditions it is possible So what we are 
going to do ? I will let me summarize what 
we are going to do ? Is to assume that we have 
a very small amplitude disturbances and then 
we derive we will linearize this non linear 
equation look for a set of linear equations 
or suppose simplifies this non linear equations 
in to a simplified linerized version And 
then we try to make more assumptions about 
the quantities and then try to see if we can 
derive some kind of simple equation simple 
linear equation which can be solved with paper 
and pencil and that has and its on utility 
no matter how simplifying the assumptions 
that we have 
So in order to refresh your memory I will 
write down the equations 
This is the conservation mass or the continuity 
equation And the momentum equation is rho 
times and I want to say that I am doing everything 
in one dimension but the three dimension is 
not too difficult And recall that s naught 
is constant that means you are saying that 
we are talking about constant entropy process 
And now what we need to do ? Is we want to 
linearize this equations So you can is the 
non linear term here This is going to give 
lot of trouble in terms of solving the equations 
And so what we want to do ? Is to say that 
the perturbations and pressure velocity density and temperature are fairly small compare to 
the mean values So we take the equations 
perturb the equations around its mean that 
way we derived the so called acoustic equations And then we say that these perturbations are 
really small So the advantage of this is 
that you can actually drop out terms which 
are product of perturbations quantities 
that way we get a linear equation and which 
we can solve So this whole process called linear acoustic 
So the assumption here is that perturbations in pressuredensitytemperaturevelocity are 
of much smaller compared to their mean values So this would be what we referred to as linear 
acoustics ? And we also assume a homogenous fluid and we say that the mean quantities 
the mean pressure mean density and mean temperature independent of the position of the medium 
And we will also say that we are a having 
a quiescent medium That means there is no 
mean velocity associated with the medium 
The mean quantities I will denote the mean 
by a over bar p bar rho bar t bar are a 
constant and u bar equal to So we have 
constant thermodynamic mean properties and 
the mean flow velocity is that means it 
is a quasion medium 
So we now write all the variables so let 
us say pressure equal to We write the variables 
as the sum of a mean quantity and the fluctuating 
quantity Prime density equal to mean density 
plus fluctuating density temperature equal 
to bar plus t prime u equal to u bar plus 
u prime So here we are saying that we have 
a quasion medium so we drop this term and 
in general you could have the pressure and 
mean pressure and density temperature varying 
but in this particular case h we are keeping 
them as constant We also say that p prime 
over p bar a is much less than rho prime 
over rho bar its negative it is much less 
than t prime over t bar is much less than 
and so on 
So now that means if p prime p bar is much lower than and rho prime by rho bar is much 
lower than then this quantities are very 
small So we can actually drop terms that 
second order quantity that means terms that 
involves products of this quantities So 
let us now perturb up this equation and write 
this in terms of this mean and mean quantity 
and the perturbation quantity and then try 
to proceed the linearise the equation So 
let us start with continuity equation 
So when you linearise this you will get dou 
by dou tau rho bar plus rho prime plus dou 
by dou x so rho bar plus rho prime into u 
bar plus u prime equal to Now I said that 
there is no u bar so we can simply erase this 
term and just say u prime equal to So 
let us expand this equation and look at each 
term So rho bar is a time average value 
of mean time r value of density so that is 
a average quantity in terms of time So by 
definition its independent of time So the 
first term will drop out see you keep only 
dou rho prime by dou t plus Let us expand 
this term so we will have dou by dou x rho 
bar u prime plus dou by dou x so rho prime 
u prime equal to Now this is a second 
order quantity Of course it is a non linear 
quantity and the trick here is that we do 
not deal with nonlinearity we are trying to 
linearise 
So we will drop this we also assume that 
rho bar is a constant It is independent of 
space we can take it outside the derivative 
So in the final equations become so let me 
say rho bar equal to constant So this would be the perturbation equation for the continuity 
equation So its like the acoustic equation 
for continuity So we need to do the same 
procedure next with the momentum equations 
So let us do that momentum equation you will have rho bar plus rho prime multiplied by 
dou by dou t of u bar plus u prime plus u 
bar plus u prime into dou by dou x So u 
bar plus u prime equal to minus dou by dou 
x So p bar plus p prime So let us simplify 
matters we said that there is no u bar term So we can drop wherever there is u bar first 
And so let us say rho bar plus rho prime into dou u prime by dou t plus u prime dou u prime 
by dou x equal to minus We said that the 
mean pressure is independent of space so we 
can drop the term and dou p bar by dou x can be droped 
So you will have just dou x Now lets expand this out So you will have rho bar dou u 
prime by dou t plus rho bar u prime dou u 
prime by dou x plus rho prime dou u prime 
by dou t plus rho prime u prime dou by dou 
x equal to minus dou p prime by dou x dou 
x So if you remember the primes stands for the fluctuating quantity or the acoustic quantity 
and once again the bar stands for the mean quantity So now we look so this is a first 
order quantity we can keep that So we keep this is a second order quantity will drop 
this also a second order quantity we drop 
that the third order quantity So let us 
write this is second order this is third order 
So we keep only the leading order 
So our equation now becomes rho bar dou u prime by dou t equal to minus dou p prime 
by dou x So this is the acoustic momentum equation Next we want to linearise the equation 
of state 
For that we said that p equal to p of rho 
comma s naught and remember that we said that 
we are having a isotropic process here So 
let us take a graphical approach Now let 
us take a look at a graph of p versus rho 
and lets say its varying in some fashion 
Let us mark our mean quantity of p bar and 
rho bar Let us say this is our mean state 
and we perturb things around it So here 
this is the region we are looking and this 
region So we although this function could be a general 
curve In this small region the pressure is 
fluctuating about a mean value And this fluctuating 
around mean value and this is a really small region and there we can say that this variation 
is linear So we have a linear variation 
in the vicinity of this base flow or the mean 
quantities we are having a linear variation 
So we can try it a linear relationship or 
write a equation of a straight line mathematically We can use a tailor series For example so 
pressure can be written as can we expanded by tailor series about its base value plus 
dou p by dou rho at constant rho p times rho minus rho bar plus half into dou square p 
by dou rho square into rho ms rho bar whole square plus higher order terms 
So lets throughout the higher order terms 
and write a keep only the linear term So 
we can say we drop them Now we can rewrite this equation as p minus p bar equal to dou 
rho by sorry dou p by dou rho as naught times rho minus rho bar So this would be the linearised 
equation of state And if you look carefully 
we know that this is our p prime and this 
is our rho prime So basically we are having 
p prime equal to dou p by dou rho at constant 
entropy times rho prime Now this is a constant 
value and we can denote it by some constant 
So we say that dou p by dou rho lets call 
its c square this by definition 
So we can say that p prime equal to c squared 
times rho prime So at this point it is not 
clear that c is its not clear that c is the 
speed of sound At this point we will have 
to wait a little bit before we can see what 
actually see physically means ? Whether it 
is speed of sound and so far 
So let me summarize the equations that we derived So let us call this equation call 
this equation call this equation Now 
I must say that something really annoying 
in the convention used in acoustic that is 
they free when it explode u keep the primes 
to some point and then suddenly the author drops the prime So generally the quantity 
without prime So for example rho prime would actually be written as rho I mean will be 
written as rho prime sometimes but p prime is staying as p prime But if you the mean 
pressure will be denoted by p bar or something but after some time and I mean this dropping 
of primes is sometimes quite annoying but 
I will try to be consistent and keep this 
notations correctly yeah thank you so And 
in the convention sometimes rho bar is written 
as rho and its very mixed up and so on But 
its better to be consistent and keep the following 
notation about primes and bars and just keep it 
So now what we do ? Is we can so we next we proceed to derive the wave equation 
So what we can do ? Is to take dou by dou t of equation and subtract dou by dou x of equation 
and then you will get And we also use p prime equal to c squared rho prime So if you do 
that here you will get So you are going 
to get over c squared dou p prime by dou 
t plus rho bar dou p prime by dou x equal 
to And here so if I take a time derivative 
of this I will get over c squared d squared 
p prime by d squared plus rho bar dou squared 
u by dou t dou x equal to 
If I take this space derivative of this equation 
What you will get ? Is rho bar dou squared u prime by dou x dou t equal to minus dou 
square t over dou x square Now you can subtract this equation from this subtract the bottom 
equation from the top equation And then you can get over c squared d squared p over 
d t square equal to dou square p by dou x 
square So this is the wave equation or this 
so called classical wave equation And we 
having at look that the physical meaning of 
c although you might have I think all of you 
know that c stands for speed of sound but 
we will have to see very carefully that what 
c is ? So let me so I must mention that I 
made a assumption here that dou squared u by dou t dou x equal to dou square dou by 
dou x dou t That is why i could subtract 
the term of or cancel the term over And of 
course that is ok when the velocity is a continues function of x and time then you solve the 
derivatives So that is we have derived the 
wave equation and will be make a few remarks 
about the wave equation 
We derived the wave equation from a fluid 
mechanic conservation laws is just from fundamentals 
The second thing I want to say those of you are mathematically incline will notice that 
this is a hyperbolic partial differential 
equation PDE stands for partial differential 
equation In fact you see that the characteristics are the d x by d t equal to plus or minus 
c I am not going to go in to much of a detail But if you are mathematically inclined you 
can persive this lineand we did not use the 
linearised equation of energy 
But actually if you work out the problem 
and if you work out the linearised equation 
of energy it will turn that the linearised 
equation for continuity equation is identical 
to the linearised equation For energy equation in this case if there may be different and 
some other case that is when you have temperature gradient or when you have combusting and so 
on These equation may be different but right now they are the same So we see this dimensional 
wave equation We can I want to make a few more probations if you do a dimensional 
derivation of it 
In dimension you would have over c square dou squared p by dou t squared equal to del 
square p In fact I have started forgetting 
my prime So I think this will happens to 
you Also so please remember to be consistent with the notation and you can also derive 
the wave equation in terms of acoustic velocity or velocity potential and so on You can do 
this as a homework So in terms of acoustic velocity 
you will also get an identical wave equation 
Now the I want to speak about certain 
characteristic of this equation This is a 
linear equation of course we linearized our 
original equation 
So naturally we will end up with a linear 
equation and this is of the most studied 
equation in maths And in fact if you had 
a minus sign here or here if you had a minus 
sign then you know What the equation this 
become ? It is a laplace equation which has 
completely different characteristics So 
the advantage of linearity is that if you 
have linear equation will have linear solutions and we can superimpose the solution 
So if you have a solutions you can add them or multiply by on constant multiply the other 
by another constant we can construct more and more solutions 
The wave equation is also homogenous There are no other source terms if there are source 
terms then the wave equation will become in homogeneous So this wave equation does not 
speak about the production of sound it only 
talks about the propagation of sound We did 
not consider any sound sources in this and 
sound source of course will come in second 
half of the course A similar equation can 
be derived for the propagation of electro 
magnetic waves in free space Of course it 
will look like a different Similarly you 
can have a wave equation for schodinger equation 
Though these are very important class of equation 
that has been well studied by the mathematicians and the physicist 
Historically the D wave equation was derived first by d Alembert for oscillations of strings 
And Euler in s derived this equation specifically for sound propagation in fluids One last 
comment the wave equation is a second order partial differential equation and it will 
have infinite number of solutions This specific solutions can be obtained of course you need 
to specify the particular boundary conditions and the initial conditions and so on 
So we will look for solutions for the travelling wave solutions standing wave solutions etcetera 
And first we will look for deriving generalized solution So the solution procedure is quite 
simple we will factorize this wave equation 
That is the wave equation and we assume that 
d square p prime by dou x dou t equal to dou square p by dou t dou x So we can actually 
factorize this equation as follows its quite 
simple to work out 
So this is a same equation factorized it 
you expand this if you expand this equation 
out you will get the equation at the top 
So then we can have possibilities is 
dou p by you have the first operator acting on pressure 
equal to or you can also have the possibility 
of the second operator acting on the pressure fluctuating pressure second operator acting 
on the fluctuating pressure makes it So 
if you look carefully you can I mean you can 
rewrite this as dou p prime by dou x plus 
over c dou p prime by dou t equal to or 
we can write dou p prime by dou t plus c times dou p prime by dou x equal to 
So you can easily see that the c is the characteristic speed d x by d t equal to c So the solution 
a generalized solution for this would be equal to f of x minus c t and similarly if you 
look at you can write this equation as dou 
p prime by dou t minus c dou p prime by dou 
x equal to So the characteristic speed 
here is dou x by dou t equal to c Yeah that 
should be c Thank you 
So this would be p prime equal to g of x 
plus c t So f prefen a sound function g 
is another function Now you can write a 
general solution as p prime equal to f of 
x minus c t plus g of x plus c t So this 
would be the general solution Now its quite 
easy to convince yourself that this solution 
actually satisfies this first equation and 
this equation actually satisfies the top equation I will just show that Let us make a change 
of variable or a transformation that will 
make things easy 
So we say that xi equal to x minus c t So 
we say that dou p prime by dou x equal to 
dou p prime by dou xi into dou xi by dou x 
Similarly we can say that dou p prime by 
dou t equal to dou p prime by dou xi into 
dou xi by dou t Now if you see dou xi by 
dou x equal to and dou xi by dou t equal 
to minus c 
So if you substitute this in here I will get 
So now if I substitute this in the wave equation 
What we had ? Was dou p by dou t plus c dou p by dou x equal to So if you make this 
substitution dou p by dou t is nothing but 
a minus c dou p prime by dou xi plus c times 
dou p prime by dou sei You can see that this actually cancel this and you will get So 
therefore f of x minus c t is actually a solution to the wave equation 
Similarly if you follow the same procedure 
except you use another variable If you use 
eta equal to x plus c t you can a prove that 
g of x plus c t is also a solution to the 
wave equation Therefore the general solution for the wave equation is p rime equal to f 
of x minus c t plus g of x plus c t So I 
must emphasize that f and g are at this stage 
simply orbiter function and we do not know 
what they are ? They could be any functions 
but the specific form of the functions depends very much on the type of initial condition 
that you use and the type of boundary conditions that we use So now lets the big question 
we have to ask is what is c ? 
So the next question is What is the meaning of c ? Towards this purpose lets just take 
a look at the first solution p prime equal 
to f of x minus c t So if you the meaning 
of this is that as long as you are on the 
line x minus c t equal to constant You will 
see the same pressure so that x minus c t 
some kind of preserved quantity So if you 
have a wave shape and it moves to some other place between similar points this quantity 
will be preserved So lets say the you are at X comma t 
at sometime at instant at another instant 
we are at X comma t Now if you are on 
this solution then you have to make sure that x minus c t is constant that is the thing 
its preserved So now you will say that or 
t minus x by c some people write x minus c 
t sometimes you can say t minus x over c 
Whatever t minus X over c equal to t 
minus X over c or we can rewrite this as 
xX minus X over t minus t equal to 
c So you can really see that t is the time 
taken by the wave travel from X to X in 
this time interval t t minus t So therefore 
c is indeed the speed of sound Now if you 
are looking at rite propagating wave Now 
f of x minus c t is right propagating wave 
because the velocity of the wave is its varying 
in to characteristic d x over d t equal to 
c And so it is a right running wave If you 
were to write the other solution we have g 
of x minus c t If you look at this solution 
What is preserved ? Is or it can possibly written as g of t minus x over u x plus 
So t plus X over c equal to t plus 
X over c So What we can see ? Is X 
minus X over c equal to t minus t or 
X equal to X minus c into t minus t 
That means actually the wave is here You can see its wave is propagating to the left 
So this is left running wave Whereas in 
the earlier case we see that the wave is propagating 
to the right because you can see that X 
equal to X plus c into t minus t So 
this a so called right right running wave 
So now you can clearly see that why is c 
is the speed of sound Now you can clearly 
see why c is actually is the speed of sound 
anything else ok So let us look at some more things about 
this solution p prime equal to f of x minus 
c t or g is equal to x plus c t So this 
means that along that x minus c t you have 
a certain shape of the wave or along x plus 
c t you have certain post shape of the wave That means we are having a solution which 
says that the wave shape is constant Wave shape does not change the amplitude doent 
change only the wave just propagates 
So we are looking at D wave or D plane 
wave because we only have a coordinate x 
So it is a plane wave So lets look at the 
futures of the D plane wave 
So with amplitude is all based is that f of g So there is no attenuation or speeding 
and the second feature is that the wave shape the wave shape does not change to any propagation 
We will see later on in the course where will 
have the situations where the amplitude and 
the shape will change during propagation 
But at the moment from this classical case 
the wave shape does not change during propagation 
So the last thing is I want to work out 
is to work out the relationship between the 
acoustic pressure and the acoustic velocity How do we go about doing this ? So we can 
actually what this out by using the acoustic 
momentum equation or the euler equation its 
linerized version 
So we are trying to derive the relationship 
between acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity 
for a plane wave So use the linareized Euler equation or the linerized momentum equation 
which is rho bar dou u prime by dou t equal 
to minus dou p prime by dou x So we can 
do this relations separately for a right propagating wave and then for a left running wave So 
let us denote the right propagating wave by 
plus and the left propagating wave by minus 
So we will write dou u prime plus over dou 
t equal to minus over rho bar dou p prime 
plus rho dou x So all we need to do is to 
say that So you can integrate with right 
hand side with respect to time and you will 
be able to get the velocity 
So we can change the variables to xi equal 
to x minus c t Then we can see that d t equal 
to minus over c d sei So d p by d x equal 
to and now if you substitute this in here 
What you can get ? Is u plus equal to minus 
over rho bar integral dou f by dou xi into 
minus over c dou xi by So this would be 
nothing but over rho bar c integral dou 
f which is f over rho bar c If you are starting with initial conditions that are a question 
So basically we can say that u plus equal 
to p plus divided by rho bar c Now if you 
were to workout this relation would the left 
running wave and that is quite easy 
So we say that eta equal to x plus c t and 
we can follow the same procedure and you can 
then derive the relation Sorry it is a you 
follow the same procedure as for integration 
you can and then you will get the results 
So it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a just to 
you would get this relation So I there is 
a minus sign in front of of p prime So in 
either case either for a left running wave 
or a right running wave the magnitude of the 
velocity is the magnitude of the pressure 
divided by rho bar c rho bar c is quantity 
called characteristic impendence Now the 
only thing is for a right running wave the 
velocity the front face velocity is u plus 
equal to p plus divided by rho bar c 
For a left running wave u minus equal to minus p minus divided by rho bar c So these are 
opposite sign this is although it looks strange that there is a different sign its quite intuitively 
obvious So let us look at the compression 
wave which is going to your right side Now 
if the wave is going to right side the gas 
particle will if the compression wave the 
gas particle will will move behind the wave 
to the right So then the sign should be 
plus because you are having the wave also 
move behind the the velocity move also to 
the positive x axis So there should be a 
plus 
Whereas the compression is going to the negative x axis then the particle will try to that 
compression wave to negative x axis So its naturally have a minus sign because its going 
into opposite direction So that is what 
that is the reason for this left running wave 
having a minus sign in front of it for the 
expression for the acoustic velocity Whereas 
right running wave has a plus sign or a positive sign before the expression for acoustic velocity 
So in general 
p plus over u plus equal to p prime minus divided by So if you take the region 
and the magnitudes will obviously rho bar 
c and rho bar c is called characteristic impendence 
of the medium Different mediums will have different value for example a would be of 
the value would be around for water it 
would be some other value 
For example let us work out rho bar c would be typically rho would be let us say kg 
per meter square into speed of sound would be typically meter per second So you 
will get approximately kilogram meter 
or minus second power minus So this 
unit kilogram will meter per minus kilogram 
per meter square second This is called the 
this unit is referred to as rayleigh in order 
to honor the great scientist dort rayliegh 
who did a law of pioneer in working acoustics Now if you are having a Now if you are having 
another medium medium water So you would have rho bar is kg per meter cube for 
water speed of sound is of the order of meter per second 
So rho bar c would be of the order of 
into power rayleigh So you can see 
that for different mediums the value of the 
rho bar c the characteristic impendence is 
quite different for different medium So 
we will stop here at this point What we did ? 
Is yes here I put a to summarize what we did ? Is we took the equations of fluid mechanics 
which we derived in last class Then we made assumptions of liner acoustic that means we 
we split the variables into a mean quantity 
and a perturbation quantity Then we said 
that the perturbation are very small compare to the mean 
So we actually neglect we kept the quantities which are first order in the perturbations 
but we neglected everything that the second order or higher And then we massage these 
equations and derived the classical wave equation Then we actually proceeded to find the solutions 
to wave equation which is as I showed earlier f of x minus c t in g of x plus c t And then 
we also derived expression for acoustic velocity in terms of the acoustic pressure So we 
will stop here today Thank you Have a good day 

' ] [ u'In the last class we derived the wave equation and please remember that we derived the wave 
equation from the fundamental equation of 
the fluid mechanics And we just took the 
equations of fluid mechanism We linearized this equations and then manipulated equation 
to get a nice linear equation which is its 
second order partial different equation and 
we actual actually solutions for this equation Now this solutions where if you remember 
of the form f of x plus c t and g f x minus 
c t 
So this x minus c t when that is the argument corresponds to the right running wave and 
x plus c t corresponding corresponds to a 
left running wave And then we also derived 
expression for acoustic velocity in terms 
of acoustic pressure we saw that they where 
related by the characteristic impedance rho 
c For the right running wave the acoustic 
velocity was acoustic pressure divided by 
rho c And for the left running wave those 
are minus sign it was negative of acoustic 
pressure divided by rho c that is the biggest 
difference in the direction of motion of the 
gas when difference in direction of the particle 
velocity that the sign is there 
Now in this class we are going to try to 
look at harmonic waves Now this is very 
simple concept and we can understand a lot 
of things Although we are often you could 
have many different frequencies but now at 
least the situation which you have just 
frequency is not all that diagram it can happen 
quit easily and you can set it up nicely in 
a laboratory 
So physically you have harmonic waves you need a sound source that gives sound at a 
single frequency And that is not too hard 
to imagine you can have a loud speaker or 
a piston which is vibrating at a single one 
particular frequency and so this is a very 
simple and ideal case of wave propagation 
And it is quote fundamental because even if 
you have transcend signals or signals with 
many different frequencies in it or waves 
that are not sinusoidal order You could actually use for the transform and then now actually 
you can express this complex signal as a super position of various different harmonic waves 
and with so if you can analyze one particular frequency you can analyze all particular frequency 
And since we are having a linear theory that is our differential equation linear and if 
our boundary condition also linear then you 
can actually solution which can be super post 
and you can construct solution for more complicated situations So let us get on with harmonic waves 
So for studying harmonic waves you would have guessed correctly that we would 
use sines or cosin and you can use either 
of them it is wave is phase shifted to get 
another So there is no problem with that So let us write 
So this is a typical expression for plane propagation of harmonic waves plane 
because we are talking about dimensional wave So X is the only special dimension 
and you can also see that this is off the 
form f of t minus X over C 
This is like you know we saw the solutions f of t minus X over C and this was the right running wave And 
if you did have the other function g of t 
plus X over C Then you could write the corresponding 
wave as a Cos pi f f is the frequency here 
times t plus X over C minus phi naught 
This is a oscillating at a single frequency 
and the frequency here is f So this is the 
f which correspond to solution which we had last time but what have written here f is 
the f is the frequency Now phi naught is 
the initial phase 
This is because depending 
on your choice of coordinate system it depending on when you stop the clock you can change 
phase depends on that it is with reference 
to a reference time So depending on the 
starting of time t equal to you need a phase because Sin and Cos depends on you know the 
phase depends on when you start your time So there are possibilities to visualize 
a harmonic wave You can either you know 
we have a function of time and X So we can 
one particular way to do this is we can freeze the time and look at it has a function of 
X the other possibilities you can freeze X 
and look it has function of time So you 
freeze the space and look at it look at the 
wave as the function of time And we can make 
out certain characteristic from it and we 
can do the opposite 
Let us be a first look at a freeze the space 
that is at particular space I am sitting 
and looking at the wave So What I could 
do ? Is to put a microphone at particular 
location and see how the wave looks like and we can take the signal from the microphone 
to oscilloscope and visualize it Let me draw how a typical signal would look like ? 
So this would be the time period T 
The period is defined as the time with the 
pattern repeats So the either the time its 
interval between crust or trough or any 
points which are similar And you have the amplitude here which is A so that is the 
amplitude of the weave and here we are Now let me mark the axis its p of its some reference 
value p of t comma t as a function of t 
And you can easily see this particular value 
if I read of this would be A Cos phi naught 
so that is because the reference phase 
So this picture clearly defines what is A ? 
What is phi naught and what is time period 
T ? And the idea is that the wave repeats after every time interval T So with that we can 
look at what happens to we can actually derive the relationship between time period T and 
frequency So if the wave repeats after every time interval T your argument will actually 
change by phi you know Sin theta is same as Sin theta plus pi 
So if you use that and say that 
So this is after a time interval T minus What was there at 
original time ? So if you say this periodic we will get a phase difference of 
pi So if you expand this you will see 
pi f t plus pi f t minus pi f X over 
C minus phi naught minus pi f t minus 
pi f X over C minus phi naught equal to 
pi not And you can see this cancels this 
cancels this cancels So what you would 
get is ? pi f T equal to pi which we can 
simplify and say f T equal to or time period 
T equal to over f I think all of you knew 
this in advance but this is like a reverse 
saying that the time period of a wave a goes like the reciprocal of the frequency 
Now we will do the other approach What we can do is ? 
In this particular example we froze the distance So we said we will stay at X equal to and 
we looked at the variation in time So instead what we can do ? Is we freeze at particular 
time and then we see the variation next How do you ? How is it possible to freeze at 
particular time ? So what we can do ? Is we 
can put microphones at various locations along 
the duct Whatever and you make measurements at instant T one particular instant of time 
you make measurements with several different microphones along your duct where sound is 
propagating and plot them so that would be the way how to get the distribution along 
space to what a you would get be something of this form 
Now what I am having is p of X coma that is the time t equal to as a function of 
X and lets mark the important features Now the distance between peaks would now be 
the wave length lambda That is the length 
of the wave that is the distance between 
different waves difference distance between different peaks you can also define it as 
different crust and so on And amplitude 
here is the same A and you also have the rough 
reference phase A Cos phi naught actually 
A Cos minus phi naught but A Cos of minus 
phi naught is same as Cos of phi naught Now you can total get a relationship between the 
wave length and the frequency 
What we can do ? Is we do the same thing as 
we did here see when the pattern repeats 
So the periodicity means you get a difference 
in phase of pi between different crust 
or different trough and so on So pi 
f times t minus X over C plus lambda lambda is the wave length minus phi naught minus 
pi f t known as X over C minus phi naught 
equal to pi So you can see this term cancels 
with this this cancels here this cancels 
here and what you would get ? Is pi f lambda 
or should have lambda over C 
X is X plus lambda over C equal to pi or 
you would get f lambda equal to C or lambda equal to C over f so that is if you derive 
the speed of sound divided by number of waves per second you would get the wave length 
I think this is also a intuitive result and 
we have derived this somewhat rigorously here 
In other words within this time interval T 
the peak has travelled the distance lambda 
at the speed c c is the speed of sound 
Now I just want to do one more definition 
which is a wave number K which is defined 
as pi over lambda and which is equal to 
pi f over C this also define omega over 
C So k is the wave number which is defined as pi over lambda which is omega over C 
omega is refer to as the angular frequency 
So we can now write the harmonic wave expression 
for a harmonic wave as follows this is what we have to begin with We can equivalently 
write this in terms of omega and also in terms of wave number we can write because omega 
over C is K 
This is written for the right running wave 
we can or similarly get expression for the 
left running wave as well How many waves 
are there per meter or or centimeter ? Whatever 
so this is the number of waves per unit distance it is very physical concept In fact this 
concept came from electromagnetic theory and sound where they were actually in spectrum 
counting how many waves over there in per 
unit distance but same thing can not close 
here Now the next think you want to do is you 
want to use the complex notation because it turns out that your algebra is very convenient 
in complex notation Its more convenient than using trigonometric functions and so let 
us try to do the derivation try to work out 
acoustic in the complex notation Its equal 
and you can either view complex numbers or you can use Cos and Sin and I will talk about 
the equivalence So 
we know the formula e power i theta equal 
to Cos theta plus i Sin theta So this is 
the basic formula how to convert bit how to go between complex numbers and Cosine and 
Sin\u2019s And lets all we would need of the 
course nothing more than that So what we 
know now is that when you say you have again i say mentioned earlier sometimes we drop 
the primes but there is really primes they 
are fluctuating pressure but if I drop it 
that is all that is because that is the standard convince to drop this but I as far I remember 
I will try to keep the primes 
so if you see this formula e power i theta is Cos theta 
plus i Sin theta So Cos theta is really the real part of 
e power of i theta If you want a function with Cos theta e and you insist and writing exponential 
e power i theta Then what you can do ? Is 
you can write Cos theta as real part of e 
power i theta So if you want let me write 
that r e refers to real part of 
So if I have a expression for a harmonic 
wave as follows I can now write it as real 
part of A e power i times k x minus omega 
t plus phi naught So when you do this e 
power i times this factor you will have Cos 
and Sin and we want only the Cos So we take 
the real part Now p prime is the real pressure there is So complex notation is a only convenient 
way to do the algebra there is nothing complex about the whole idea it is just of we are 
using complex numbers Now we knew use the term complex number we say that the Cos theta 
is there plus i times Sin theta we say i is 
imaginary number 
For example we say that if you have a number a plus i b we call a the real part and we 
say b is the imaginary part i b is the imaginary part but i want the emphases that there is 
nothing imaginary about the imaginary numbers it is just a bad nomenclature So you can 
think of a plus i b that we can alternatively 
think of it as quantity is describing something 
it is like if you are the vector a times i 
plus b times j 
So suppose we have a vector a times i plus 
b times j this i and j are the basis function 
they are the unit vector along i is the unit 
vector along the x axis j is the unit vector 
along y axis Now we write the vector along this basis function using this basis function 
So a and b are the components which are the projections along this basis functions So 
instead of using i and j the basis functions 
that we use are coma and coma coma 
in conventional convent ally we refer as 
and comma i we refer to as 
i So it is just complex numbers is a quality which helps you to did in some point which 
need too thing to be specified So complex 
numbers enable to do that So although we 
have a real part and imaginary part The imaginary part is not only imaginary thing it is just 
a convenient way of notation and you see that here in complex When use this we actually 
use imaginary numbers to denote phase as I will show you Now in a few minutes time 
So suppose we where to expand this out 
So we can say that p of prime of x comma 
t equal to A e power i times K x minus omega 
t minus phi naught This can be recast as 
A e power i phi naught times e power i k x 
times e power minus i omega t Now what we can do ? Is we can club these thing together 
this is the function of this So we can call 
it p hat of x This is a function of space 
times e power minus i omega t This amplitude is called the complex amplitude p hat of x 
is the complex amplitude I must emphasis 
thing here we should not take the complex 
amplitude and take its real part that is meaningless We take the complex amplitude multiplied by 
e power i omega t and then take the real part of the whole thing that will give the real 
instantaneous pressure is that clear Let 
me repeat again we take the complex amplitude 
multiplied by e power i omega t e power i 
omega t or here its e power minus omega t 
taking is both this will be Cos omega t i 
Sin omega t So you do whole multiplication 
and then take the real part and that is what 
gives instantaneous pressure Next I will 
show the equivalence between these notations 
So let us say we have the quantity p hat 
of x times e power i omega t we can do the 
same thing with e power i omega t If you 
stick with on you should stick with the same 
thing throughout with your calculation that 
is what is important If you can show where 
you use e power i omega t or e power minus i omega t you will get the same results So 
just start to be consistent and so if you 
expand this out you will get p real of x 
plus i times So the hat usually denotes complex amplitude 
So let us multiply this thing out So what 
you get ? Is p l of x times Cos omega t minus 
p imaginary of x times Sin omega t plus i 
times p i needs to hats sorry x times plus 
peril of x times Sin omega t So this is 
the real part and what we are interested in 
as I mentioned the instantaneous pressure 
is take the in this pressure this whole thing 
p hat x e power i omega t So this is the real part and that is what we are interested in 
So this it is this 
this quantity I will let me just write it again 
Now I will do algebraic manipulation What 
I will do ? Is take the square of p r square 
plus p imaginary square its square root and 
we will multiply and divide by that So what 
we get is So already it is multiply the numerator and denominator by the same quantity So 
it is really the same factor this will cancel 
minus Now we can say that you know very 
simple algebra 
Now we can say this is expression is same 
as p here squared of x plus p imaginary squared 
of x times We can write this term as let 
us say Cos phi and this term as let us say 
Sin phi and you know that if you square this 
plus square this you will get So this 
its p r square plus p imaginary square divided by this quantity square So you will get 
add this square this term and square this 
term add them 
So this we can write as Cos phi Cos omega t minus Sin phi Sin omega t This could be 
recast as root of p real square plus p imaginary square times Cos omega t plus phi where we 
form therefore phi is tan phi equal to p 
imaginary of x divided by p real of x needs 
to hat So you can see that the imaginary 
part actually is the another way of the presenting the phase 
imaginary part is another way of 
representing the phase So nothing imaginary 
about it is just it is just a reference And 
this quantity is this is actually is the amplitude 
of the signal 
So this is actually the amplitude which could be written as square root of p hat star 
So we need more things to be done we have 
to talk about How to express acoustic velocity in terms of acoustic pressure ? We also need 
to talk about acoustic displacement amplitude in time domain we derived a relation for acoustic 
velocity in terms of acoustic pressure and 
actually there are relation for the forward 
running wave and for the backward running left running and right running wave Let us 
do that for the case of harmonic domain 
frequency 
So if we remember our momentum equation was rho bar equal to minus rho p prime by rho 
x So let us say you hat equal to when I 
write this it is implied that the actually 
taking the real part So even when you say 
text book they would not often write u prime 
is real part of you had e power of i omega 
t that is implied enough to states similarly 
we can write p hat equal to now we remember that this complex amplitude is actually a 
it can be a function of space so that is 
why put the function of dependence So if 
you now substitute the equations here I will 
get rho bar u when you differentiate u of 
x it just states it is not a function of 
time times differentiate e power i omega t 
you will get i omega e power i omega t 
So this would be minus rho p hat x over rho 
x or e power i omega t does not have any x 
So it justice now e could cancel this So 
you can say that you hat of x equal to minus over i omega rho rho p hat by rho x 
So this is the relationship between acoustic velocity and acoustic pressure In the harmonic 
domain I must emphases that when you say u hat of x that is really the particle velocity 
that is if you think of a fluid partials it 
is the velocity of the fluid particles 
That is different from the speed of the way 
Now just to give a analogy to make this things 
clear Suppose you are standing in a line 
let us say you are going to a movie and you 
are standing in a line and somebody pushes the last fellow in the line and then he pushes 
the guy in front and he pushes the person 
in front and so on So eventually the push 
was started at the end of the line travels 
forward and it will be going till the guy 
the front of the just before the ticket counter Now the wave itself actually move across 
the line although each person only move little bit So the push will go at certain speed 
all through the line that would be equivalent to our probation of the wave The pattern 
itself moving but each person moves little 
bit when the push happens that would be like 
our particle velocity so that would be a 
very cued analogy but I hope it helps you 
to understand the difference between particle velocity and phase velocity 
So the see which is the speed of sound that is the rated which the wave propagates that 
is different from how much the fluid particle moves this is very important and when we say 
you had a fax this is u is called acoustic 
velocity And this is different from C C 
is the speed of sound So please remember to distinguish between these The last thing 
I want to speak about is the relationship 
between particle replacement and particle 
velocity 
So its quite simple displacement and velocity can be written by sorry differentiate the 
displacement and you get the velocity So 
this is the so we say u prime equal to u 
hat e power i omega t and we say xi of x equal to xi of x hat times e power i omega t So 
you substitute it here you get u hat e power 
i omega t equal to i omega So times e power 
i omega t So this cancels so you get the simple relationship 
between the acoustic velocity and the particle velocity and the acoustic velocity So we 
did not say anything about the energy in the wave So the next issue we are addressing 
is to look at how much energy is there in 
the wave and try to writ the expression for 
it and try to see expression to look at evolution 
energy 
So this would be called Acoustic Energy Corollary Corollary because we are not deriving anything 
from first principles We are taking the momentum equation and the continuity equation and from 
those equations we are getting another equation So we are not deriving equation from scratch 
the existing equations the continuity momentum equations are there and we deriving energy 
equation which is compatible with that so 
that is why it is called corollary it is 
from something which is already existing 
Recall that the momentum equation or the Euler\u2019s 
equation form rho bar dou u prime by dou t 
plus dou p prime by dow x equal to What 
I will do ? Is to multiply this equation by 
u prime and now I have rho bar 
what I will do ? Now is to write u prime dou 
p prime by dou x can be written as dou by 
dou x of u prime p prime minus p prime So why I am doing it you will see it in a minute 
it leads to some important physical research of this be patient Now let us substitute 
this over here you will get rho bar dou by 
dou t of u prime square divided by plus 
dou by dou x of p prime u prime this time 
here minus p prime dou u prime by dou x equal to 
Now what we need ? Is a expression for dou u prime by dou x So we can get that 
from the linearized continuity equation 
So now we have a explained for dou u prime by dou x which is here We also note that 
remember last class we said rho prime equal to p prime over c square So you substitute 
that in here we will get minus over rho 
bar dou by dou t of p prime So what we going 
to do ? Is to substitute this equation here 
and you will get rho bar u prime square over 
by plus dou by dou x of p prime u prime 
minus over rho bar c square We have a p 
prime multiplying d t prime by d t So you 
get dou by dou t of p prime square over 
equal to So we can drop this term and 
this term together and write very nicely 
So we can say 
So this would be the Acoustic Energy Corollary 
So let us call that will be w of the term 
half rho bar u prime square plus half p prime 
square over rho bar c square This is the 
term which was inside the derivative So 
we can what is this w ? 
You could imagine w is nothing but kinetic energy and this would be potential energy So we can 
say that dou by dou t of w plus dou by dou 
x of p prime u prime equal to this is the 
so called Acoustic Energy Corollary 
So this above equations is for the dimensional 
case if you where having a general dimensional case you would still have a equation which 
is similar this is for dimension case for 
D What you would have ? is 
a instead of dou by dou x we will have del dot p v equal to where w will now be defined as half 
rho bar e dot v or this negative dot velocity 
square plus half p prime square over p naught 
c square And this term inside the radian 
that is p v vector quantity this is called 
I this is the acoustic intensity vector This 
is in a differential form what we can do is 
we can integrate this over a control volume 
And then what we can do is let us say we are integrating this equation over a control volume 
this is the control volume plus now you can 
you use Gauss theorem to convert this sorry 
this diversion term into a surface integral 
So this is the integral form this has very 
important physical meaning What this means ? Is time rate of change of acoustic energy 
in the control volume equal to the flux of 
intensity which is coming in minus the flux 
of intensity that is going out I will write 
this in words So this intensity coming in 
of flux its flux coming in minus intensity 
out across the control surface 
So what does this physically mean ? So if 
you have some amount of acoustic energy hat 
is coming in from the coming from the boundaries Let us say we have a nut here and here from 
boundaries So if lot of energy is more energy is coming into the control volume from the boundary\u2019s 
and if more is coming in than what is going out then naturally the energy 
in the control volume will increase Now 
if more energy is going out compared to what 
is coming in then you would have the acoustic energy in the control volume decrease Now 
if they are saying whatever is coming in whatever is going out acoustic energy will stay same 
or if nothing is coming out and nothing is 
coming in very ridge walls and cavity then 
the acoustic energy will stay same 
So these are very beautiful result it is 
called Acoustic Energy Corollary Later on 
in the course when we speak about the onset 
of thermo acoustic instabilities and how sound drives sound is driven by fluctuations and 
heat release rate we will actually be deriving extensions of e equation with source term 
right Now there is no source term here there if you can have things coming from you can 
have things coming from boundary in a row 
but nothing produced inside in reality you 
can imagine things sound can be produced Sound is always produced somewhere the other 
h So we are concerned about democratic instability So if there is a flame here and if there 
is some mechanism with which sound is produced then we have to account for it So we have 
to modify this equation to account for source term there could also be volumetric terms 
which take away the energy for example here could be if you think about solid rocket kind 
of situation n solid rocket motor 
How does instability very big problem of democratic 
instability solid rocket motors ? So what 
they do is solid rocket motors use aluminous 
propellant and now aluminum severs four purpose the alumina gives the percent of alumina 
alumina is very advantage from a specific 
impulse point of view aluminum burnt from 
alumina and this actually has a very high 
heat release weight And we get very high 
temperature rise because of this therefore 
you get extra thrust you get higher specific 
impulse But also source of another important purpose 
from point of view of combust instability 
there these particles alumina particles in 
they are molten form In which is there in 
the gas form to face flow mixture and there 
actually dam the oscillation in the particles 
They start moving with the oscillations d 
they take away the energy from the oscillations So that would be like a sink so that be like 
a volumetric sink So you can have inside 
a volume you can have both volumetric sources 
and volumetric sink at the moment We have not does with any of them but when we the 
evil in the second of the class derived expressions which you deal with volumetric sound sources 
and volumetric sound sink 
Now does more thing that I want to say 
here actually that is really throwing a spanner in the works We spoke about considering acoustic 
energy but really in our situation that is 
for example in engines or any such flow situations 
we actually have different types of fluctuations acoustic is just of them we have vortices 
fluctuations And we have entropy fluctuations and I must also say that we have written this 
whole wave equation and this flow analysis 
everything in the absence of mean flow We 
are looking at a quiescent medium 
So in the presence of moving medium the corollary 
gets much more complex and it and further 
if you have entropy disturbances or entropy 
fluctuations And if you vortices fluctuations and there is a quite a bit of debate and what 
is the acoustic energy itself ? So many people are working on it its even it is a topic of 
current interest So you do not have a very 
simple research like this you love much more 
complex yourself We will speak about it again in the second round of the class you have 
to dominantly daily with dimension situation So what happens to the acoustic intensity 
in a dimension situation ? 
So in dimensional situation if we have 
only the x component So we have only u 
So we just have v equal to u times i So 
and if you are looking at a let us consider 
a special case of plane way we have u equal to p over rho bar c So then we can say I 
equal to p prime square over So this the 
expression for acoustic intensity for dimensional 
case its p prime square over rho bar c So 
it can be reduced purely from pressure measurements 
So I will stop today\u2019s lecture with this 
what we did we looked at harmonic waves We 
got expression for harmonic waves then we converted look found equivalent expressions 
in terms of exponential functions So we 
looked at Cos and Sin as well as e power i 
x and then we also derived expression for 
acoustic velocity in terms of acoustic pressure 
We also talked about acoustic displacement particle displacement then we also looked 
at the why we need a imaginary quantity or 
complex number ? What is the relevance of the 
imaginary quantity ? We saw that it is simply another way of denoting the phase And lastly 
we derived the equation for the evolution 
of acoustic energy It is a Corollary it was 
derived from continuity and momentum equations Then we also introduced the concept to acoustic 
intensity I will stop with this Have a good 
day
